## What is econmic's meaning
The word economy comes from a Greek word for "one who manages a
household."
A household and an economy face many decisions
who will work? 
what goods and how many of them should produced?
What resources should be used in production?
At what price should the goods be sold?

The management of society's resource is important because resource are scarce.
Scarity means that society has limited resources and therefore cannot produce all the goods and services people wish to have.

Economics is the study of how society manages its scarce resources.

## What the Economists study
How people make decisions.
How people interact with each other.
The forces and trends that affect the economy as a whole.


## Ten principles of Economics
How People Make Decisions
1 People face tradeoffs.
2.The cost of something is waht you give up to get it
3.Rational people think at the margin
4.People respond to incentives.

How People Interact
5. Trade can make everyone better off.
6. Markets are usually a good way to
organize economic activity.
Governments can sometimes improve economic outcomes.

How the Economy as a whole Works
8. The standard living depends on a country's production.
9.Prices rise when the government print
too much money.
10.Society faces a short-run tradeoff
between inflation and unemployment.

1. People face tradeoffs.
Efficiency v Equity
Efficiency means society get the mos
that it can from its scarce resources.
Equity means the benefits of those resources are distributed fairly among
the members of society.

The cost of something is waht you give up to get it.

Decisions require comparing costs and benefits of alternatives.
Whether to go to college or to work?
Whether to study or go out on a date.
Whether to go to class or sleep in

The cost of something is
waht you give up to get it
Why have some contries experiences rapid growth in incomes over the past century while other stay mired in provery? Why do some countries have high
rates of inflation while other others maintain stable price? Why do all countries experience recession and depressions-recurrent periods of falling incomes and risingunemployment-and how can government policy reduce the requency and severity of these episodes?
The management of society's resources is important because resources are
scarce. Scarity mean  that society has limited resources and therfore cannot produce all the goods and services people wish to have. Just as a household cannot
give every member everything he or she wants, a society cannot give every individual the highest standard of living to which he or she might aspire.
Economics is the study of how society manages its scarce resources. In most
socities, resources are allocated not be a single central planner but through the
combined actions of millions of households and firms. Economists also study how

how peple make decisions: how much they work, what they buy, how much they
save, and how they invest their savings. Economists also study how
one another. For instance, they examine buyers and quntity
Althoug the study of economics has many facets, the field is unified by sereral
central ideas. I the rest of this chapter, we look at Ten Principle of Economics.

The principle recur throughout this book and are introduce here to give you an overview of waht economics is all about. You can think of this chapter as a
pre-view of coming attractions.

How People Make Decisions
There is no mystery to what an economy is. Whether we are talking about the
economy of LosAngeles, of United States, or of the whole world, an economy is just a group of people interact with one another as they go about their lives.
Because the behavior of an economy reflects the behavior of the individuals who make up the economy, we start our study of economics with four principla of individual decision making.

PRINCIPLE #1 PEOPLE FACE TRADEOFFS
the first lesson about making decisisions is summarized in the adage: " There is no such thing as a free lunch". To get one thing that we like, we usually have to giev up another thing that we like. Making decision requires trading off one goal against another.
Consider a decide allocate can spend studying spend studying psychology; divide fields. gives up gives up spent napping
Or considering parents deciding how to spend their family income. They can buy
food, clothing, or a family vacation. Or they can save some of the family income
for retirement or the children's colledge education. When they choose to spend an
extra dollar on one of these goods, they have one less dollar to spend on some
other good.
When people are grouped into societies, they face different kinds of tradeoffs.
The classic tradeoff is between "guns and butter". The more we spend on national
defense to protect our shores from foreign aggressors (guns), the less we can spend
on consumer goods to raise our standard clean environment and a high level of
in modern society is the tradeoff between a clean environment and a high level
of income. Laws that require firms to reduce pollution raise the cost of producing
goods and services. Because of the higher costs, these firms end up earning smaller
profits, paying lower wages, charging higer proces, or some combination of these three. Thus while pollution regulations give up the benefit of a cleaner environment and the improved health that comes with it, they have the cost of reducing
the incomes of the firms' owner, workers, and customers.
Another tradeoff society faces is between efficiency and equity. Efficiency
means that society is getting the most it can A

which exerts friction on the falling . Yet the physicist will corretly point out the friction on the marble is so small that its effect is negligible. Assumpimg the marble falls in a vacuum greatly
Economists make assumptions for the dame reason: Assumptions can make the world easier to understand. To study the effect of internaltional trade, we assume the world consist of two countries and that exh coutry produces only two goods.  Of course the real world consit of dozens of coutries, each of which produces thousands of different types of goods. But by assuming two countries and two goods, we can focus our thinking. Once we understand international trade in an imaginary world with two countries and two goods, we can focus our thinking. Once we understand international trade in an imaginary world with two coutries and , we are in better position to understand international trade in the more complex world in which we live.

The art in scientific thinking-whether in physics, biology, or economics-is deciding which assumptions to make. Suppose that we were dropping a beach ball rather than a marble. Ourphysicisr would realize that the assumption of no friction excerts a greater force on a beach ball than on a marble. The assumption that gravity workd in a vacuum is reasable for studying a falling marble but not for studying a falling beach ball.
Similarly, economics use different assumptions to answer different questions.

EVery field of study has its own language and its own way of thinking. Mathematicans talk about axioms, integrals, and vecor spaces. Psychologists talk about ego, id, and cognitive dissonance. Lawyers talk about venue, torts, and promissory estopppel. Economics is no differnet. Supply,d demand, elasticity, comparative afvantage, consumer surplus, deadweight loss- these terms are part of the economists's language. In the coming chapters, you will encounter many new terms adn some familiar words that economists use in specialize ways. At first, this nee language may seem neddlesly arcane. But as you wiil see, its value lies in its ability to pro-vide you a new and usefule way of thiniking about the world in which you live.
The single most important of this book is help you learn the economist's way of thiniking. Of course, just as you cannot become a mathematicain, psychologist, or laywer overnight, learning to think like an economist will take some time.Yet with a combination of theory, case studies, and exmple of economics in the news, this book will give you ample opportunity to develop and practice this skill.
Before delving into the substance and details of economics, it is helpful to have an overview of how economists.
address their subject with a scientist's objectivity. They approach the study of the economy in much the same way as a physical approaches the study of matter and a biological approaches the study of life: They divise theories, collect data, and then analyze thses data in an attempt to verify or refute their theories.
To beginners, it can seem odd to claim taht economics is a science. After all, economics do not work with test tubes or telescopes. The essense of science,
however, is the scientific method-the dispassionate development and testing of theories about how the world works. This method of inquiry is as applicable to  studying a nation's economy as it is to studying the earth's gravity or species' evolution. As Albert Einstein once put it, "The whole of science is nothing more than the refinement of everyday thinking."
Althoug Einstein's comment is as true for social science such as economics as it is for natural sciences such as physics, most people are not accustomed to looking at society through the eyes of a scientist. Let's therefore discuss some of the ways in which economics apply the logic of scient to examine how an economy works.

Issac Newton, the famous seveteenth-century scientist and mathematican, allegedly became intrigurr. This interplay between theory and observation also occurs in the field of economics, An economist might live in a country experiencing rapid increase in prices and be moved by this observation to develop a thery of inflation. The theory might assert that high infaltion arises when the government prints too much money. To test this-thery, the economist could collect and anlyze data on proices and money from many different countries. If growth in the quantity of money were not at all related the rate at which prices are rising, the economists would start to doubt the validity of his thery of inflation.If money growth and inflation were strongly correlated in international data, as in fact they are, the economist would become more confident is his theory.
Although economists use theory and observation like other scientist, they do face an obstacle that make their task especially challenging: Experiments are often difficult in economics. Physicists studying gravity can drop many objects in their laboratories to generatedata to test their theories. By contrast economists studyin inflation are not allowd to manipulate a nation;s monetay policy simply to generate useful data. Economists, like adtronomers and evolutionary biologists, usually have to make do with whaever data the world happens to give them.
To find a substitue for labratory experiments, economists pay close attention to the natural experiments offered by history. When a war in the Middle EAst interrupts the flow of crude oil, for instance, oil prices skyrocket around the world. for consumers of oil and ooild products, such an event depresses living standards. For economics policymakers, it poses a difficult choice about how best to respond.But foe economic scientists, it provides an oppertunity to study the effects of a key natural resource on the world's economies, and this oppotunity persists long after the wartime increase in oil prices is over. Throughout this book, therefore, we consider many historiacal episodes, Thee episodes are valuable to study because they give us insight into economy of the past and, more important, because they allow us to illustrate and evaluate economic theories of the present.
The role of Assumptions
If you ask a physicist how long it would take for a marble to fall from the top a ten-story building, she willanswer.


Similarly, economics use different assuptions to answer different quetions. Suppose that we want to study what happens to the economy when the government changes the number of dollara in circulation. An important piect of this analysis, it turns out, is how prices respond. Man prices in the economy change infrequently; the newsstand prices of magazines, for instance, are changes only every few years. Knowing this fact may lead us to make different assumptions when studying the effects of the policy change over different time horizons. For studying the short-run effects of the policy, we may assume that prices do not change much. We may even make the extreme and artificial assumption that all prices are completely ficed. For studying the long-run effects of the policy, how-ever, we may assume that all prices are completely flecible. Just as a physicist uses different assumptions when studying falling marbles and fallin beach balls, economists are different assumptions when studying the short-run adn long-run effects of a chang in the quantity of money.


Hish scholl biology teachers teach basic anatomy with plastic replicas of the human body. These models have all the major organs-the heart, the liver, the kid-neys, and so on. The models allow teachers to show their students in a simple way how the improtant parts of the body fit together. Of course, these plastic models are not actual human bodies, and no one would mistake the model for a real person. These models are stylized, and thet omit many details. Yet despite this lack of realism-indeed, because of this lack of realism-studying these models is useful for learnig how th ehunman body workd.
Economists aslos use models to learn about the world, but instead of being made of plastic, they are most often composed of disgrams and equations. Like a biology teacher's plastic mode, economic models omit many details to allow us to see what is truly important. Just as the biology teacher's model does not include all of the body's muscles and capillaries, an economists' model does not include every feature of the economy.
As we use models to example variou economic issues throughout this book, you will see that all the models are built with assumptions, Just as a physicist be-gind the analysis of a falling marable by assuming away the existence of friction, economists assume waway many of details of the economy that are irrelevant for studying the question at hand. All models-in physics, biology, or economics-
simplify reality in order to improve our understanding of it.
OUR FIRST MODEL: THE CIRCULAR-FLOW DIAGRAM
this economy consists of millions of people engaged in many activities-buying, selling woeking, hiring , manufacturing, and so on. To unserdtand how the conom.When a war in the Middle East interrupts the flow of crude oil, for instance, oil prices skyrocket around the world. For consumers of oil and oil products, such as an event depresses living standards. For economic scientists, it provides and ir provides an opportunity to study the effects of a ky natuaral resource on the world's economies, and this opportunity persits long after the wartime increase in oil prices is over. Througout this boolk, therfore, we consider many historical episodes. These episodes are valuableto study because they give us insight into the economy of the pst and, more important, because they allow us to illustrate and evaluate economic theories of the present.

The economy has two types of decisionmakers-house-holds and firms. Firms produce godds and services usin ginputs, such as labor, land, and capital (building and machines). These inputs are clalled factors of production and consume all the goods and services that firms produce.
Households and firms interact in two types of markets. In the markets for goods and services, households are buyers and firms are sellers. Inparticular, households buy the output of oggds and services that firms produce. In the marget for the factors of production, households are sellers and firms are buyers. In thses markets , households provide firms the inputs that firms use to produce goods and services. The circular-flow diagram offers a simple way of organizing all economic trasaction that occur between households and firms in the conomy.
The inner loop of the circular-flow disgram reprenets the flows of the goods and services between households and firms. The households sell the use of their labor, land, and capitalto the firms in the markets for the factors of production. The firms thhen use these factors to produce goods and service.
The outer loop  of the circular-flow disgram represents the corresponding flow of dollars. The households spend money to buy goods and services from the firms.The firms use some of the revenue from thses sales to pay for the factors of the production, such as wages of their workers. What's left is the profit of the firm owners, who themselves are members of households. What

such as wages of their workers. What's left id the profit of the firm owners, who themselves are members of households. Hence, spending on goods and services flow from households to firms, and income in the form of wages, rent, and profit flows from firms to housholds.

Let' stake a tour of the circular flow by following a dollar bill as it makes ists way from person to person through the economy.
Image the dollar bill as it makes its way from person to person through the economy. Imagein that the dollar begins at a household, sitting in, say, your wallet. If you want to buy a cup of coffes, you take the dollar to one of the exonomy's markets for goods and services, such as you local Starbucks coffee shop. There you spend it on your favorite drink. When th dollear moves into the Starbucks cash register, it becomes revenue for the firm. The dollar doesn;t stay at Starbucks for long, however, because the firm uses it to buy inputs in the markets for the factors of production. for instance, Starbucks might use dollar to pary rent to its landlord for the spce if occupies or to pay the wages of its worker. In either case, the dollar enters the income of some household and, once again , is back in someone's wallet. At taht point , the story of the economy's circular flow starts once again.
The circular-flow diagram in Figure 2-1 is one simple mode of the economy. It dispense with details that, for some purposes, are significant. A more complex and realistic circular-flow model would include, for instance, the roles of government and international trade. Yet these details are not crucial for a basic understanding of how the economy is organized. Because of its simplicity, this circular-flow disgram is useful to keep in mind when thinking about how the pieces of the economy fit together.
Our second model: the production possibilities frontier
consider one of the simplest such models, called th eproduction possibilities frontier, adn see how this model illustrates some basic conomic ideas.

:w
Points on the production possibilities frontier represent efficient levels of production. say A, no way to produce more of one good without producing less of the other. B an inefficient outcome.  widespread unemployment, th eeconomy is producing less than it could from the resources if has available: It is producing only 300 cars and 1000 computers. One of the Ten principles is that people face tradeoffs. Th production  possibilities frontier shows one tradeoff taht society faces. Once we have reached the points on frontier, th eonly way of getting more of one good is to get less of the other. When the economy moves from point A to point C, for instance, society produces more computers but at the expense of producing fewer cars.

Another of the Ten pricniples of Economics is that the cost of something is what you give up to get it. This is called the opportunity cost. The production possibilities frontier shows the opportunity cost of one good as measured in terms of the other good. When society reallocates some of the factors of production from the car industryto the computer industry, moving the economy from point A to poinC, it gives up 100 cars to get 200 additional computers. In other words, when the economy is at point A, the opportunity cost of 200 computers is 100 cars.
Notie that the production possibilities frontier in Figure 2-2 is bowed out-ward. this means that the oppoortunity cost of cars in terms computers depends on how much of each good the economy is producing. When the economy is using most of its resources to make cars, the production possibilities frontier id quite steep. Because even wokers and machines gets a substantial increase in the number of computers for each car it gives up. By contrast, when the economy is using most of its resouces to make computers, the production possibilities frontier if quite falt. In this case, the resources best suited to making computers are already in the computer industry, and each car the economy gives up yields only a small increase in the number of computers.

The production possibilities frontier show the tradeoff between the production of different goods ata a given time, but the tradeoff can change over time. For example, if a technological advance in the computer industry raises the number of computers that a worker can produce per week, the economy can make more computers for any given number of cars. As a result, the production possibilities frontier shfts outward, as in Figure 2-3. mentioned briefly. As you study economics, ehese ideas will recur in various forms. The production possibilities frontier offers one simple way of thinking about them.

MICROECONOMICS AND MACROECONOMICS
Many subjects are studied on various levels. Consider biology, for example. Molecular biologists study the chemical compounds that make up living things. Cellular biologists study cells, which are made up of may chemical compounds and, at the dame time, are themselves the building blocks of living organisms. Evolutionary biologists study the many varieties of animals and plants and how species change gradually over the centuries.
Economics is also studied on various levels. We can study the decisions of individual households and firms. Or we can study iteration of households and firms in markets for specific goods and services. Or we can study the opertaion of the economy ad a whole, which is just the sum of the activities of all these decision-maker in all these markets.
The filed of economics is traditioanlly divided into two broad subfields. Micoeconomics is the study of how households and firms make decision and how they interact in specific markets. Macroeconomic is the study of economy-wide phenomena. A microeconomist might study the effects of rent control on housing in New York City, the impact of foreign compettion on the U.S. auto industry, or the effects of compulsory scholl attendance on workers' earnings. A marroecomist might study the effects of borrowing by the federal goernment, the changes over time in the economy's rate of unemployment, or alternative policies to raise growth in national living standards.
Microeconomic and macroeconomics are closely interwinded. Because changes in the overall economy arise from the decisions of millions of individuals, it is impossible to understand macroeconomic developments without considering the assocated microeconomic decsiosn. For  eaxample, a macroeconomist might study the effect of a cut in the federal income tac on the overall production of goods and services. To analyze this issue, he or she must consider how the tax cut affects the decisions of households about how much to spend on goods and services.
Despite the inherent link between microeconomics and macroeconomics, the two fields are distict. In economics, as in biology, it may seem natural to begin with the smallest unit and build up. Ye doing so is neither necessary nor always the best way to procees. Evolutionary biology is, in a sense, built upon molecular biology, since species are made up of molecules. Yet molecular biology and evolutionary biology are separate fields, each with its own questions and its own methods. Similarly, because microeconomics adn macroeconomic address different quetions, they sometimes take quite different appoaches and are often taught in separate courses.


Often economists are asked to explain the causes of economics events. Why, for ex-amples, if unemployment higher for tennagers than for old workers? sometimes economists are asked to recommend policies to improve economic outcomes. What , for instance ,, should government do to improve the economic well-being of teenagers? When economists are trying to explain the woeld, they are scientists. When they are trying to help improve it, they are policy advisers.


Positive versus normative analysis
to help clarify the two roles that economists play, we begin by examining the use of language. Because scientists and plicy advisers have different goals, they use language in different ways.
For example, supose that two people are discussing minimum-wage laws. Here are two statements you might hear:
Poliy: Minimum-wage laws cause unemployment.
Norma: The government should raise the minimum wage.
Ignoring for now whether you agree with these statements, notice that polly and Norma difer in what they are trying to do. Polly is speaking like a scientist: She is making a clain about how the world workd. Norma is speaking like a policy adviser: She is making a clain about how she would like to change the world.
In general, statements about the world are of two types. One type, such as Polly's, is positive. Positive statements are descriptive. They make a claim about how the world is. A second type of statement, such as Norma's, is normative. Normative statements are prescriptive. They make a clain about how the world ought to be.
A key difference between positive and normative statements is how we judge their validity. We can, in principle, confirm or refute positive statements by examining evidience. An economists might evaluate Polly's statement by analyzing data on changes in minimum wages and changes in unemployment over time. By contrast, evaluating normative statements involves values as well as facts. Norma's statements cannot be judeged using data alone. Deciding what is good or bad policy is not merely a matter of scient. It also involves our views on ethics, religion, and political philosophy.
Of course, positive and normative statements may be realted. Our positive views about how the world works affect our normative views about what policies and desirable. Polly's claim that minimum wage causes unemployment, if true, might lead us to reject Norma's conclusion that government shoul raise the minimum wage. Yet our noenamtive conclusion cannot come from positive analysi alone. Instead, they require both positive analysis and value judgements.
As you study economics, keep in mind the distiction between positive and normative statements. Much of economics just tries to explain how the economy works. Yet often the goal of economics is to improve how the economy works. When you hear economists making normative statemetns, you know they have crossed the line from scientist to policy adviser.

by contrast, evaluating. Norma's statement cannot be judged using data alone. Deciding what is good or bad policy is not merely a matter o

President Harry Truman once said that he wanted to find a one-armed economist. When he asked his economists for advice, they lways answered, "On the one hand, .... On the other hand,..."
Truman was right in realizing that economists's advice is not always straight-forward. This tendency is tooted in one of the Ten Principle of Economics in Chapter1: People face tradeoffs. Economists are aware that tradeoffs are involved in most policy decisions. A policy might increase efficiency at the cost of equaity. It might help future generations but hurt current generations. An economists who says that all policy decisions are easy in an economists not to be trusted.
Truman was also not alone among presidents in relying on the advice of economists. Since 1946, the president of the United States has received guidance from the council of Economics Advisers, which consists of three members and a staff of several dozen of economists. The council, whose offices are just a fee steps from the White House, had no duty other than to advise the president and to write the annual Economic Report of the President.
The president also receives input from economists in many administrative departments. Economists at the Department of Treasury help design tax policy. Economists at the Department of Labot analyze data on workers and those looking for work in order to help formulate labor-market policies. Economists at the Deparment of Justice help enforce the nation's antitrust lawa.
Economists are also found outside the administrative branch of government. To obtain independent evaluations of policy proposals, Congress relies on the advice of the Congressional Budget Office, which is staffed by economists. The Federal Reserve, the quasi-government institution that sets the nation's monetary policy, employs hundreds of economists to anlyze economic developments in the United States and throughout the world. Table 2-1 lists the Web site of some of these agencies,
The influence of economists on policy goes beyond their roles ad advisers: Their research and writings often affect policy indirectly. Economists John Maynard research and writings often affect policy indirectly. Economists John Maynard Keynes offered this observation:
The ideas of economists and political philosophers, both when they are right and when they are wrong, are among powerful man is commonly understood. Indeed, the world is ruled by little else.  Practical men, who believe themselves to be quite execmpt from intellectual infulences, are usually the slaves of some defunct economists. Madmen in authority, who hear voices in the air, are distillin their fenzy from some academic cribber of a few years back.

Raimondo Reiterates Need for Ameraican to Lead on CHIPS in Protecting Ameraca's Economic and National Security.

One years ago, U.S. Secretary of Commerce Ginal Rainmondo delivered a speed at Georgetown University's Scholl of Foreign Service where she outlined her vison in implementing President Biden's historic CHIPs and Science Act. Last week, she procided and upgrate on its implementation and announce that future projects will be prioritized based on whether the can be operational by 2030, putting America on track to produce 20% of the world's leading-edge logic chips by the end of the decade.This announcement reflects President Biden's commitement to lead the world in the production of the semiconductors while stimulating private sector investment and creatinf good-paying jobs for all Americans.

During her remarks at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), Secretary Ramondo stressed that semidonductors are the single most important piece of hardware int he 21st century that America must increase chip-making in the U.S. to protect both America's economic and national security. Secretary Raimondo also emphasized how AI has spurred the unprecedented demand for laeding-edge chips from the semiconductor insutry.

To date, three investments have been made in current and mature chip companies - BAE, Microchip, and Global Foundries - and major, multi-billion-dollar announcements are ecpected over the coming weeks.

We anticipate that our put us on track to , up to zero percent we produce today.

In addition, the National Semiconductor Technology Center was created to address.

The role of Federal Home Loan Banks in Financial System
Lawmakers created Federal Home Loan Banks FHLBs as a government-sponsored enterprise(GSE) to support mortage lending by the bank's member institutions, which include commerical banks an insurance companies. This report describes the toles of FHLBs in financial markets,
Thei financial condition, the vlue of the federal subsidies they receive, and the risks they pose.
CBO estimates that because of their GSE status, FHLB will receive subsidies in fiscal year 2023 totalling $7.3 billon (the central estimate, with a plausible range of 5.7 billion to 8.9 billion).
FHLBs' activities may lead to lower interest rates on single-family resiential mortages, but the effect on rated is difficult to quntify.

in CBO's projections, federal budget deficits total 20 trillionover the 2025-2034 period and federal debt held by the public reaches 116 percent of GDP. Economic growth slows to 1.5 percent adn then continues at a moderate pace.

The Federal Budget
The deficit total 1.6 trillion in fiscal year 2024, grows to 1.8 trillion in 2025, and then returns to 1.6 trillion by 2027. Therafter, deficits steady mount, reching 2.6 trillionin 2034. Measures in relation to gross domestic product (GDP), the deflicti amount to 5.6 percent in 2024, grows to 6.1 percent in 2025, anf then shrinks to 5.2 percent in 2027 and 2028. After 2028, deficits climb as a percentage of GDP, returning to 6.1 percent in 2034, since the Greate Depression, deficits have exceeded that level only during and shortly after World War II, the 2007-2009 financial crisis, and the coronavirus pandemic.

Most of these propositions would fail to command a similar consen. The first proposiion in the table is about rent control. For reasons we will discuss in Chapter 6, almost all economists beleive that rent control adversely affects the availability and quality of housing and is very costly way of helpin g th emost needy members of society. Nonetheless, many city governments chooses to ignore the advice of economists and place ceiling on the rents that landlords may charge their tenants.
The second proposition in the table concerns tariffs and import quotas. For reasons we will discuss in chapter 3 and more fully in chapter 9, almost all economists oppose sunc barrier to free trade. Nonetheless, over the years, the president and congress have chosen to restrict the import of certain goods.

The study of economics does not seem to require any specialized gifts of an unusually high order. Is it not...a very easy subject compared with the higer branches of philosophy or pure science? An easy subject, at which very few excel! The paradox finds its explanation, perhaps, in that the master-economist must possess a rare combination of gifts.  He must be be mathematician, historian, stateman , philosopher- in some degree. He He must understand symbols and speak in words. He must contemplate the particular in terms of the general, and touch abstract and concrete in the same flight of thought. He must study the present in the light of the past for the purpose of the future. No part of man's nature or his instituitions must lie entirely outside his regard. He must be purposeful and disintereseted in a simultaneous mood; as aloof and incorruptible as an artist, ye sometimes as near the earth as a politician. It is a tall order. But with practice, you will become more and more accustomed to thiniking like an economist.


Economists try to address their subject with a scientist's objectivity., they make appropriate assumptions and build simplified models in order to understand the world around them. Two simple economic models are the circular-flow diagram and the production possibilities frontier.
The field of economics is divided into two subfields: microeconomics and macroeconomics. Microeconomists study descison making by households and firms and the interaction among households and firms in the marketplace. macroeconomists study the forces and trends that affect the economy as a whole.
A positive statement is an assertion about how the world is. A normative statement is an assertion about how the world ought to be. When economists make normative statements, they are acting more as policy adviserd than scientists.
Economists who advise policymakers offer conflicting advice either because of differences in scientific judgements or because of differences in values. At other times, economists are united in the advice they offer, but policymakers may choose to ignore it.

 Trade Market Government Inflation Unemployment

The fundamental lessons about interactions among people that trade van be mutually benefical. markets are usually a good way of coordinating trade among people, and that the government can potentially imprive market outcomes if there is some market failure or if the market outcome is inequitable. The fundamental lesson about the economy as a whole are that productivity is the ultimate source of living standards, that money growth is the a short-run tradeoff between inflation and unemployment.
A Country's Standard of Living Depends on Its Ability to Produce Goods and Services.


The differences in living standards around the world are staggering. In 1997 the average American had an income of about $29,000. In the same year, the average Mexican eraned $8,000, and the average Negerian earned #900. Nor surprisingly, this large variation in average income is reflected in various measures of the quality of life. Citizens of high-income countries have more TV sets. more cars, better nutrition, better health care, and longer life expectancy than citizens of low-income countries.
Changes in living standards over time are also large. In the United States, incomes have historically grown abot 2 percent per year. ( after adjusting for changes in the cost of living). At this rate, average income doubles every 35 years. Over the past century, average income has risen about eightfold.
What explains these large differences in living standards among countries and over time? The answer is suprising simple. Almost all variation in living standards is attributable to differences in countries's productivity-that is, the amount of goods and services produce from each hour of a worlder'time. In nations where workers can produce a large quantity of good and service per unit of tiem, most people enjoy a high standard of living; in nations where workers are less productive, most people can endure a more meager exisitence. Similarly, the growth rate of a nation's productivity determines the growth rate of its average income. In the same year, the average Mexican eraned $8,000, and the average Negerian earned #900. Nor surprisingly, this large variation in average income is reflected in various measures of the quality of life. Citizens of high-income countries have more TV sets. more cars, better nutrition, better health care, and longer life expectancy than citizens of low-income countries.

Similarly, the growth rate of a nation's productivity determines the growth rate of its average income..
If productivity is the primary determinat of living standards, other explanation must be of secondary importance.
For example, it might be tempting to credit labor unions or minimum-wage laws for the rsie in livinig standards of American workers over the past century. Yet the real hero of American workder is their rising productivity. As another example, some commnentators have claimed that increased competition from Japan and other countries explains the slow growth in U.S. income over the past 30 years. Yet the real villain if not competition from abroad but flagging productivity growth in the Untied State.
key quetion is how it will affect our ability to produce goods and services. To boost living standards, policymakers need to raise productivity by ensuring that worker are well educated, have the tools needed to produce goods and services, and have access to the best available technology.
In the 1980s and 1990s, for example, much debate in the United States centerd on the government's budget deficit-the excess of government spending over government revenue. As we will see, concern over the budget deficit was base largely on its adverse impact on productivity. When the government needs to finance a budget deficit, it does so by borrowing in financial markets, much as a student might borrow to finance a college education or a firm might borrow to finance a new factory. or a firm might borrow to finance a new factory. As the government borrows to finace its deficit, therefore, it reduce the quantity of funds available for other borrowers, The budget deficit therby reduces investment both in human capital (the student's education) and physical capital(the firm's factory). Because lower investment today mean lower productivity in the future, government budget deficit are generally thought to depress growth in living standards.

but some are in the range we saw in the early 2010s, when the economy was really struggleing to recover form the financial crisis. Today's economy is in a very different place. The rate of job openings is running about one-third higher than waht we saw just before the pandemic, shich was a pretty strong labor market. We are seeing it in the broader economy, as well.

A positive statement is an assertion about how the world is. A normative statement is an assertion about how the world ought to be. When economists make normative statements, they acting more as as policy advisers than scientists.

Economics who advise policymakers offer conflicting advice either because of differences in scientific judgements or because of differneces in value.

6. Classify the following topics as relating to microeconomics or macroeconomics.


WE stated by discussing how individual make decisions and then look at how people interact with one another. All these decisions and interactions together make up the economy. The last three principles concern the working of the economy as a whole.

What explains these large differences in living . productivity= that is , the amount of goods and services produces from each hour of a worker's time. In nations where workers can produce a large quantity of goods and services perunit of time. most pople must endure a more meager existence.

The production possibilities frontier shows the tradeoff between the procution of different goods at a given time, but the tradeoff can change over time. For example, if a technological advance in computer industry raises the number of computer that a worler can produce perweek, the economic can make more computer for any give number of cars. As a result the production possibilities frontier shifts outward, as in Figure 2-3.BEcause of this economic growth , socity might move production from point A to point E, enjoying more computer and more cars.
The production possibilities frontier simplifies a complex economy to highlight and clarify some basic ideas. We have used it to illustrate some of concepts mentioned briefly in Chapter 1: scarcity, efficiency, tradeoffs, opportunity cost, and economic growth.  As you study economics, these ideas will recur in various forms. The production possibilitied frontier offers one simple way of thiniking about them.
For some reason, perhaps widespread unemployment, the economy is producing less than it could from the resources it has available: It is producing only 300 cars and 1,000 computers. If the source of the inefficiency were eliminated, the economy could move from point B to pointA, increasing production of both cars(to 700) and computers(to 2,000).

Several centuries ago, astronomers debated whether the earth or the sun was at the center of the solar system. More recently, meteorologists have debated whether the earth is experienceing "global warming" and , if so, why. Science is a search for understanding about the world around us. It is not suprising that as the search continues, scientists can disagree about the direction in which truth lies.
Economics often disgree for the same reason. Economics is a young science, and there is still much to be learned. Economists sometimes disgree because they have differenct hunches about the validity of alternative theories or about the size of important parameters.
For example, economists disgree about whther the government should levy taxes based on a household's income or its consumption tax believe that the change would encourage households to save more, because income that is saved would not be taxed. Higher saving, in turn , would lead to more rapid growth in productivity and living standards.

The field of economics is traditionally divided into two broad subfields. Microeconomics is the study of how households and firms make decisions adn how they interact in specific markets. Macroeconomics is the study of economy wide phenomena. A microeconomist might study the effects of rent control on hosuing phenomena. A microeconomist might study the effects of rent control on hossing in New Yokd City, the impact of foreign competition on the U.D. auto industry, or the effects of compulsory schaool attendance on workers' earnings. A macroeconomists might study the effects of borrowing by the federal governmetn, the changes over time in the economy's rate of unemployment, or alternative policies to raise growth in national living standards.

Classify each of the following statements as positive or normative. Explain.
a. Society face a short-run tradeoff between inflation and unemployments.
b. A reduction in the rate of growth of money will reduce the rate the rate of inflation.
c. The Federal Reserve should reduce the rate of growth of money.
d. Scoiety ought to require welfare recipoents to look fro jobs.
e. Lower tax rates encourage more work and more saving.

9. If youe were a president, would you be more interested in your economic advisers' positive views or their normative views? Why?
The Economic Report of the P

The Economic Report of the President (ERP) is an annual report produced by the council of Economic Advisers. An importtant vehicle for prresenting the Adminstration's Domestic and international economic policies, it provides an overview of the nation's economic progress with text and extensive data appendices.

Our Nation has faced tremendous challenges in recent years. A deadly pandemic and unprovoked war in Ukraine have tested out economy unlike any time since the Greate Depression. When I was sworn into office, COVID-19 was raging and our economy wes reeling. Millions of workers were out of a job, through no fault of their own. Hundreds of thousands of businesses had closed, out supply chains were snarled, and many scholls were still shuttered. Families across the country were feeling real pain.
Today, two years later, 230 mi. And American families are starting to have a little more breathing room.
It is important to remember, however, taht the economic anxiety so many have felt did not start with the pandemic. For decades, the backbone of America, the middle class, had been hollowed out. Too many American jobs have been shipped overseas. Union have been weakened, Once-thriving cities and town have become shadow of what thet used to be, robbling people of hard-earned pride and self-worth.
I ranfor President to reuild our economy from the bottom up and middle out, not from the top down-because when the middle class does well, the poor have a ladder up and the wealthy still do well. We all do well. And that is what we have been working for. This past year, we made critical investments to secure America's future. Together, The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the CHIPs and Science Act, and the Inflation Recuction Act represent the biggest public inverstments in our history-expected to draw more than 3.5 trillion in public and prive funding for infrastructure, the digital economy, and clean energy over the next decade.
First, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Lwa is an investment in America and our competitiveness. You cannot be the number one economy in the . FAmilies across the nation will have safe drinking water will allow more os us to drive cleaner cars. To date, we have funded over 20,000 construction projects all across the country, creating tens of thousands of well-paying new jobs. Americans everywhere can take pride in seeing shovels in the ground.
Second, the CHIPS asn Science Acct, which I signed in Auguse, will make sure that America once again leads the world in developin and manufacturing the semiconductors that power everything from cars to refreigerators to smartphone. The UnitedStates invented these chips; it is time to again manufacture them at home, adn to make sure our economy never again relies so heavily on foreign chipmakers. Private companies have already announces more 300 billion in new investments in American manufacturing in the last two years, many of them thanks to this law, creating tens of thousands more jobs of the future in every croner of the country.
Thirs , the Infaltion Recuction Act, also enacted last August, takes on powerful special intereste to cut costs for working families. It lower health care adn prescription drug costs-for example, capping insulin at 35 a month for seniors of Medicare, adn cappinf drug costs as 2,000 a year for Act's subsides, saving families an average of 800 a year.investing in everything from climate-smart agriculture to more resilient electri grids. It builds a new clean energy economy, creating thousands of green jobs in communities too often left behind, while also lowering home energy bills for families.
meanwhile, my Administration has taken wide-ranging executive actions to help level the playing field and promote competition. From easing the burden of crippling student debt, to providing relief to families at the gas pump, to cracking down on unfair junk fees, we are building an economy that gives everyone a fair shot and a little more breathing room.
Throughout, we have shown that we can invest in our future and be fiscally resposible at the same time. We are helping to pay for these historic programs by finally making the wealthy and corporations pay their fair share, withou raising taxes on anyone making under 400,000 a year. And we cut the deficit by 1.7 trillion during my first two years in office, the largest reduction in history, with more to come.
I have often said that a job is aout more than a paycheck; it is about dignity and respet. this is why we are not only investing in record job growth; we are also providing historic support for workers and unios ata time of big shifts in our workforce. We plan to ban noncompete agreements for 30 million workers who have been unfairly locked in their jobs, giving them the right to be paid what they are worth. We have boosted pay and labor protections for Federal contractors, we have pushed to extends these same protectoins to all workers, and we . We are investing in job-training programs and registered apprenticeships, which give so many people a ladder up to well-paying jobs on which they can raise a family withouf a college degree.
Now it is time to finish the job. We have much more to do to build an economy that benefits everyone-from cracking down on the deady fentanyl epidemic and invseting in mental health care and recovery, to fighting for childcare and paid family leave for millions of working families struggling to care for their loved ones, so no one ever again has to choose between the paycheck they need and the amily they love.

Many of the concepts that economists study can be expressed with numbers-the price of bananas, the quantity of bananas sold, the cost of grwoing bananas, ans so on. Often these economic variables are related to one another. When the price of bananas rises, people buy fewer bananas. One way of expressing the realtionships among variables is with graphs.
Graphs serve two purposes. First, when developing economic theories, graphs offer a way to visually express ideas that might be less clear if described with equations or words. Second , when analyzing economic data, graphs provide a way of thinking how variables are in fact related in the world. Whether we are working with theory or with data, graphs provide a lens through which a recognizable  forest emerges from a multitide of trees.
Numerical information can be expressed graphically in many ways, just as a thought can be expressed in words in many ways. A good writer chooses words that will make an argument clear, a description pleasing, or a scene dramatic. An effective economist choose the type of graph that best suits the purpose at hand.
In this appendix we discuss how economists use graphs to study the mathematical relationship among variables. We also discuss some of the pitfalls that can arise in the use of graphical methods.
Graphs of A single Variable
Three common graphs are shown in Figure 2A-1. The pie chart in panel (a) shows how total income in the United Stated is divided amng the sources of income, including compensation of employees, corporate profits, and so on. A slice of the pie represents each source's share of the total. The bar graph in panel (b) compares a measure of average income, called real GDP per person, for four contries, The height of each bar represents the average income in each countries. The height of each bar represents the average income in each country. The time-series graph in panel (c) trace the rising productivity in the U.S. business sector over time. The height of the line shows output per hour in each year. You have probably seen similar graphs presented in newspaper and magazine.

Graphs of Two Variables: The Coordinate System
Although the three graphs in Firure 2A-1 are usefull in showing how a variable changes over time or across individuals, such graphs are limited in how much they can tell us. These graphs display information only on a single variable. Economists are often concerned with the relationships between variables. Thus, they need to be able to display two variables on a single graph. The coordinate system makes this possible.
Suppose you want to examine the rlationship between study time and grade point average. For each student in your class, you could recors a pair of numbers: hours per week spent studying and grade point average. These numbers could then be palces in parentheses as an ordered pair and appear as a single point on the graph. Albert E., for instance, is represented by the ordered pair(25hours/week, 3.5GPA), while his "what-me-worry?" classmate Alfred E. is represented by orderd pair(
the two coordinates in the ordered pair tell us where the point is located in relation to the origin: x units to the right of the origin and y units above it.
Figure 2A-2 graphs grade point average against study time for Alber E., Alfred E., and their classmates. This type of Grapsh is called a scatterplot because if plots scatterd points. Lokking at this graph, we immediately notice taht points farther to the right (indicating more study time) also tend to be higher (indicating a better grade point average). Because study time and grade point avarage typically move in the same direction. We say that these two variables have a positive correlation. By contrast, if we were to graph party time and grades, we would likely find that higher party time is associated with lower grades; because these variables typically move in opposite directions, In either case, the cooridinate system makes the correlation between the two variables easy to see.

Curves in the coordinate system
Students who study more do tend to get higer grades, but other factor also influence a student's grade. Previous preparation is an important factor, for instance, as are talent, attention from teachers, even eating a good breakfast. A scatterplot like Figure 2A-2 does not attempt to isolate the effect that stufy from teh effects of other variables. Often, however, economists prefer looking at how one variable affects another holding evverything else constant.
To see how this is done, let's consider one of the most important graphs in eco-nomics-the demand curve. The demand curve traces out thea demand curve, however, consider Table2A-1, which shows how the number of novels that Emma buys depend on her income and on the price of novels. Whenthe novels are cheap, Emma buys them in large quantities. As they become more expensive, she borrows books from the library instead of buying them or choose to go to .
To see how this is done, let's considerone of the most important graphs in sconomics-the demand curve. The demand curve traces  out the effect of a good's price on the quantity of the good consumers want to buy. Before showing a demand curve, however, consider  which shows how the number of novels that Emma buys depends ong her income and on the price of novels. As they become more expensive, she borrows books from the library instead of buying them or choose to go to movies instead of reading. Similarly, at any given proce, Emman buys more novels when she has a higer income. That is, when her income increases, she spend more novel when she has a higer income. We now have three variables-the price of novels , income, and the number of novels purchased-which is more than we can represent in two dimensions. To

because the price and the quantity demanded are negatively related, the demand curve slopes downloads.We need to hold. economists prefer looking at how one variable affects another holding everything else constant.

prevoius preparation is an important factor , for instance, as are talent, attention from teacher , even eating a good  breakfast. A scatterplot like figure does not attempt to isolate the effect taht study has on grades from the effects of other variables.
we need to hold one of the three variables constant and trace out the relationship between the other two. Because the demand curve represents the relationship between price and quantity demanded, we hold Emma's income constant and show how the number of novels she buys varies with the price of novels.
Suppose that Emma's income is $30,000 per year. If we place the number of noel Emma purchases on the x-axis and the price of novels on the y-axis, we can graphically represent the middle column of Table. When the points that represent these entries from the table-(5 novel, $10), (9 novels, $9), and so on -are connected, they form a line. this line, pictured in Fiigure 2A-3, is known as Emma's demand curve for novels; it tells us how many novels Emma purchases at any given price. The demand curve is downwward sloping, indicating that a higher demanded and the . Because the quantity of novels demanded and the price move in opposite directions, we say that the two variables are negatively related. (Conversely, when two variables move in the same direction, the cur relating them is upward sloping, and we say the vari
Now suppose that Emma's income rises to $40,000 per year. At any given price Emma will purchase more novels than she did at heer previos Just as earlier we drew Emma's demand curve for novels using the entries from the middle column. We now draw a new demand vurve using the entries from the right-hand column of the table. This new demand curve is pictured alongside the old one (curve D1) if Figure. the new curve is a similiar line drawn farther to the right. We therefore say that Emma's decmand curve for novels shifts to the right when her income increases. Likewise, if Emma's income were to fall to $20,000 per year, she would buy fewer novels at any given price and her curve would shift to the left(to curve D3).
In economics, it is important to distinguish between movements along a curve and shifts of a curve. As we can see from Figure, if Emma earns $30,000 per year and novels cost $8 a apiece, she will purchase 13 novels per year. If the price of novels falls to $7, Emma will increase her purchases of novels to 17 per year. The demand curve, however, stays ficed in the same place. The demand curve, however, stays ficed in teh same place. Emma still buys the same number of novels at each price, but as the price falls she moves along her demand curve from left to the right. By contrast, if the price of novels remains fixed at $8 but her income rises to $40,000, Emma increases her purchases of novels from 13 to 16 per year. Because Emma buys more novels at each price, her demand curve shifts out, as show

There is a simple way to tell when it is necessary to shift a curve. When the variable that is not named on either axis changes, the curve shifts. Income is on neither the x-axis nor the y-axis of the graph, so when Emma's income changes, her demand curve must shift. Any change taht affects Emma's purchasing habits besides a changes in the price of novels will result in a shift in her demand curve. If , for instance, the public library closes and Emma must but all the books she wants to read, she will demand more novels she wants to read, she will demand more novels at each proce, and her demand curve will shift to the right.  Or if the price of movies falls ena Emma spends more time at the movie and lesss tiem reading, she will dmand fewer novels at each price,a and her demand curve will shift to the eft. By contrast, when a variable on an axis of the graph changes, the curve does not shift. We read the change as teh movement along the curve.

lope
one question we might want to ask abot Emma is how much her purchasing habits respond to price. Look at the demand curve pictured in Figure 2A, If this curve is very steep, Emma purchases nearly the same number of novels regardless of whether they are cheap or expensive. If this curve is much flatter, Emma purchases many fewer novels when the prices rises. To answer quetions anout how much one variable respond to changes in another variable, we can use the concept of slope.
The slope of a line is the ratio of the vertical distance covered to teh horizontal distance covered as we move along th eline. This definition is usually written out in mathematical symbols as follows.

where the Grrek letter delta stands for the change in a variable. In other words, the slope of a line is equals to the
where the Greek letter A delata stand for the change in variable. In other words. The slope of a line is equalto eht rise (change in y) diveide by the run(change in x). The slope will be a small positive number for a fairly flat upward-stoping line, a large positive number for a steep upward-sloping line, and a negative number for a downward-sloping line. A horizontal line had a slop of zero because in this case the y-varaible never changes, a vertical line is defined to hace an infinite slop beause the y-variable can take any value without the x-varaible changing at all.
What is the slope of Emma' demand curves for novels? First of all, because the curve slopes down, we know th eslope will be negative. To calculate a numerical value for the slope, we must choose two points on the line. With Emma's income at $30,000, she will purchase 21 novels at a price of $6 or 13 novels at a price of $8.
When we apply the slope formula, we are concerned with the difference with them, which lets us know that we have to substract one set of values from the other, as follows:
	slope = delty - deltx = first y-coordinate -second y-coordinate / first x-coordinate - second x-coordinate = 6-8 / 21 - 13 = -2 / 8 = -1 / 4.
Figure 2A-5 shows graphically how this calculation works. Try computing the slope of Emma's demand vurve using two different points, You should get exactly the same result.One of the properties of a straight line is that is has the same slope everywhere. This is not true of other types of curves, which are steeper in some places than in others.
The slope of Emma's demand curve tells us something about how resposive her purchase are to changes in the price. A small slope (a number close to zero) means that Emma's demand curve is relatively flat; in this case, she adjusts the number of novels she buys sustantially in response to a price change. A larger slope(a number farther from zero) .
We know that changes in the price of novels cause changes in the quantity Emma demands. Remember, however, taht our demand curve came from a hypothetical example. Wehn graphing from the real world, it is often more difficult to establish how one variable affects another.
The first problem is that is is difficult to hold everything else constant when measuring how one variable affects another. If we are not able to hold variables constane, we might decide that one variable on our graph is causing changes in the other varibale when actually those changes are caused by a third omitted varaible not pictured on the graph. Even if we have identified the correct two variables to look at, we might run into a second problem-reverse causality. In other words, we might decide that A causes B when in fact B causes A. The omitted-variable and reverse-causality traps requires us to proceed with caution when using graphs to draw conclusions about causes and effects.

Omitted Varaibels To see how omitting a variable can lead to a deceptive graph, let'd consider and example. Imagine that the government, spurred by public concern about the large number of deaths from cancer, commissions and exhausive study from Big Brother Statistical Services, Inc. Big Brother examine many of the items found in people's homes to see which of them are associated with the risk of cnacer. Big Btother reports a strong relationship between tweo variables: the number of cigarette lighters that a househodl owns and the probaility taht someone in the houehold will development cancer. Figure shows this relationship.

In judging the validity of Big Brother's analysis, one quetion is paramount: Has Big Brother held constant every relevant variable except the one under consideration? If the anser is no, the results are suspect. An easy explanation for Figure is that people who own more cigarette lig

The synched Service method here reveals a weakness in any technique involving opern call. The call to service form within synchedSrvice results in teh lock being held throughout the duration of service, including the call to h.operation. This defeats the purpose of the method restructurings. Avoiding sunch problems requires documentation of the intentional lack of syncrhonization in classes used in concurrent settings.

Economists can also make mistakes about causality by misreading its direcition. To see how this is possible, suppose the Assocaition of American Anachists  commissions a study of crime in America and arrives at Figure., which plots the number of violent crimes per thousand people in major cities against the number of police officers per thousand people. The an
The anarchists note the curve upward slope and argue that because police increase rather than decrease the amount of urban violence.o

if we could un a controlled experiment, we would avoid the danger of reverse causality. To run an experiment, we would set the number of police officers in different cities randomly and then examime the correlation between police and crime. Figure, however , is not based on such an experiment. We simpley observer that more dangerous cities have more police cities. The explanation for this may be taht more dangeroud cities hire more police. In other words, rather than police causing crime, crime may cause police. Nothing in the graph itself allows us to establish the direction causality.
It might seem that an easy way to determine the direction of causality is to examime which variable moves first. If we see crime increase and then the police force expand, we reach one conclusion. If we see the police force expand and then crime decrease, we reach the other. yet there is also a flaw with this approachL Often people change their behavior not in response to a change in their present conditions but in response to a change in their expectation of future conditions. A city that expects a major crime wave in the future, for instance, might well hire more police now. This problem is even easier to see in the case of babies and minivans. Couple often buy a minivan in anticipation of the birth of a child.minivan comes before the baby, but we wouldn't want to conclude that the sale of minivans causes the population to grow!
There is no complete set of rules taht says when it is approriate to draw causal conclusion from graphs. Yet just keeping in mind taht cigarette lighters don;t cause cancer(omitted variable) and minivans don't vause larger families (reverse causality) will keep you from falling for many faulty economic arguments.

AT first , this discussion of incentives and seat belts might seem like idle speculation. Yet in a 1975 study, economist Sam Peltzman showed that the auto-safety laws have, in fact, had many of these effects. According to Peltzman's ecidence, these laws produce bothe fewer deaths peraccident adn more accidents. The ne result is a littel change in the number of driver deaths and an increase in the number of pedestrain deaths.

ratoinal people think at the margin
Decisions in life are rarely black and white but usually involve shades of gray. When it'time for dinner, the decision you face is not between fasting or eating like a pig, but whether to take that extra spoonful of mashed potatoes. When exams roll around, your decision if not between blowing them off or studying 24 hours a day, but whether to spend and extra hour reviewing your notes instead of watching TV. Economists use the term marginal changes to describe small incremental adjustments to an existing plan of action. Keep in mind that margin means, edge. so marginal changes are adjustments around edges of what you are  doing.

In many situations, people make the best decsions by thinking at the margin. supose, for instance, that you asked a friend for advice about how many years to stay in schaoll,. If he were to compare for you the lifestyle of a person with a Ph.D. to taht of a grade scholl dropout, you might complain that this comparision is not helpful for your decsion. You have . To maek this decsidion, you need to know the additional benefits that an extra year in scholl would offer( higher wages throughout life and the sheer joy of learning) and the additional costs taht you would incur(tuition adn the forgone wages while you'are in scholl). an extra year in scholl would offer hiher wages throughout life and the sheer joy of learning and the additional cost that you would incur(tiotion and the forgone wages while you are scholl)

In fact, th eopposite is true: Trade between two countries can make each country better off.
To see why, consider how trade affects your family. Families also compete against one another when they go shopping, because each family wants to buy the best goods at the lowest prices. So in a sense, each family in the economy is competing with all other families.
Despite this competition, your family would not be better off isolating itself from all other families. If it did, you family would need to grow ite own food. Trade allows each person to specilize in the activities he or she does best, whether if is farming, sewing, or home building. By rtrading with other, people can buy a greater variety of goods and services at lower cost.

allocate resources through the decentralized decsiond of many firms and households ad they interact in markets for goods and services.


to understand how this invisible hand workd its magic.

Nonetheless, for various reasons, the invisible hand sometimes does not work. Economists use the term market failure to refer to a situation in which the market on its own fails to allocate resources efficently.. The classic example of an external cost is pollution. If a chemical factory does not bear the entire cost of the smoke it emits, it will likely emit too much. Here, the government can raise economic weel-being through enviromental regulation. The classic example of an external benefit if the creation of knowledge. When a scientist makes an important discovery, he produces a valuable resource that other people .

The invisible hand is even less able to ensure that economic prosperity is distributed fairly. A market economy rewards people according to their ability to produce that other people are willing to pay for. The world's best basketball player earns more than the worlds' bess chess player simply because people are willing to pay more to watch basketball than chess. The invisible hand does not ensure that everyone has sufficient food, decent clothing, and adequate health care. A goa of many public plocies, such as the income tac and the welfare system, is to achive a more equatable distribution of economic well-being.

The study of economics does not seem to require any specilaized gifts of an unusually high order. Is is not...a very easy subject compared with the higher branches of philosophy or pure science? An easy subject, at which very few excel!The paradox finds its explanation, perhaps, in that the master-economiist must possess a rare combination of gifts. He must be mathematican, historian, stateman, philosopher-in some degreee. he must understand symbols ans speak in words,. He must contemplate the particular in terms of the general, and touch abstract and concrete in the same fight of the thougt. He must study the present in the light of the past for the purposes of the future. No part of man's nature or his institutions must lie entirely outsied his regard. He must be purposeful and disinterested in a simultaneous mood; as aloof and incorruptible as an artist, yet sometimes as near the earth as a politician.

There is a simple way to tell when it is necessary to shift a curve. He demand curve must shift. any change that affects Emma's purchasing habits besides a change in the price of novels will result in a shift in her demand curve. If for instance, the public library closes , she will demand more novels and Emma spends more time at the moveies and less time reding, she will demand fewer novels at each proce, and her demand curve will shift to the left.By contrast, when a varaible on an axis of the graph changes, the curve does not shift. We read the changes as a movement along the curve.


Slope

To calculate the slope of the demand curve, we can look at the changes int the x- and y-coordinatesThe slope of the line is the ratio of the change in the y-coordinate(-2) to the change in the x-coordinate(+8), which equals -1/4

ge exactly the same slope everwhere. This is not true of other type of curves, which are steeper in some places than in others.

The slope of Emma's demand curve tells us something about how resposive her purchases are to changes in the price.

A larger slope means that demand is steep. no doubt about cause and effect.

mireading its direction
We simply observe that the more dangeroud cities hire more police.
Often people change their behavior not in response to a change in their present conditions but in response to a change in their expectations of future conditions.

on your television made in Japan.  You get dresses in clothes made of cotton grown in Georgia and sewn in factories in Thailand. You drive to class in a car made of parts manufactured in factories in Thailand. You drive to class in a car made of parts manufactured in more than a dozen countries around the world. Then you open up your economics textbook written by an author living in Massachusetts, published by a company located in Texas, and printed on paper made form trees grown in Oregon.
EVery day you rely on many people from around the world, most of whom you do not know, to provide you with the goods and services that you enjoy. Such inter-dependence is possible bacause people trade with one another. Those people who provide you with goods and services are not acting out of generosity or concern for your welfare. Nor is some government agency directing them to make waht you want and to give it to you. Instead, people provide you and other consumers with the goods and services they produce because they get something in return.
In subsequent chapters we will examine how our economy coordinates the activities of millios of people with varying tasts and abilities. As a starting point for this analysis, here we consider the reasons for economic interdependence. One of the Ten Principles of Economics highlighted in Chapter 1 is that trade can make eceryone better off. This principle explains why people trade with their neighbors and why nations trade with other nations. In this chapter we examine this principle more closely. What exactly do people gain when they trade with on another? Why do people choose to become interdependent?

Imagine that there are two goods in the world-meat and potatoes. And there are two people in the world-a cattle rancher and a potato farmer-each of whom would like to eat both meal an potatoes.
The gains from trade are most obvious if the rancher can produce only meat and the farmer can produce only potatoes. In one scenario, the rancher and the farmer could choose to have nothing to do with each other. But after several months of eating beef roasted, boild, broilded, and grilled, the rancher might decide that sel-sufficeincy is not all it's cracked up to be. The farmer, who has been eating potatoes mashed, fried, baked, adn scalloped, would likely agree. It is easy to see that trade would allow them to enjoy grater variety: Each could then have a harmburger with french fies.
In this case, should the rancer or farmer choose to remain self-sufficient? Or is there still reason for them to trade with each other? To anser the question, we need to look more closely at factors that affect such a decision.

PRODCTION POSSIBILITIES
Suppose taht the farmer and the rancher each work 40 hours a week and can devote this time to growing potatoed, raising cattle, or a combination of the two.
Table shows the amount of time each person required to produce 1 pound of

The farmer can produce a pound of potatoes in 10 hours and a pound of meat in 20 hours. The rancher, who is more productive in both activities, can produce a pound of potatoes in 8 hours and a pund of meat in 1 hour.
all his time . divides his time equally between the two activities, spending 20 hours on each, he produces 2 pounds of potatoes and 1 pound of meat.

This graph is the farmer's production possibilities frontier. As we discussed in Chapter 2, a production possibilities frontier show the various mixes of output that an economy can produce. It illustrate one of the Ten Priciples of Economics in Chapter1: People face tradeoffs. Here the farmer faces a tradeoff between producing meat and producing potatoes. You may recall that the production possibilities frontier in Chapter 2 was drawn bowed out; in this case , the tradeoff between the two goods depends on the amounts being produced. here, however, the farmer's technology for producing meat and potatoes (as summarized in Table 3-1) allows him to switch between one good and the other at a constant rate. In this case, the production possibilitied frontier is a straight line.
Panel (b) of Figure 301 shows the production possibilities frontier for rancher. If the rancher devotes all 40 hours of her time to potatoes, she produces 5 pounds of potatoes and no meat. spending 20 hours on each activity, she produces 2 1/2 pounds of
Once again, the production possibilities frontier shows all the possible outcomes.
If the farmer adn rancher choose to be self-sufficient, rather than trade with each other, then each consumer exactly what he or she procuces. In this case, the production possibilities frontier is also the consumption possibilities frontier. That is , without trade, Figure 3-1 shows the possible combinations of meal and potatoes taht the farmer and rancher can each consume.
That is , withou trade, Figure 3-1 shows the possible combinations of meat and potatoes that the farmer and rancher can each consume.

Although these production possibilities frontier are useful in showing the tradeoffs that the farmer and rancher face. Too determine their choices, we need to know the tastes of the farmer and the rancher. Let's suppose they choose the combinations identified by points A ans B in Figure3-1: The farmer produces and consumes 2 pounds of potatoes and 1 pound of meat, while the rancher produces and consumes 2 1/2 pounds and 20 pounds of meat.

Farmer: Tahe seemds like a good ideal for me. But I don't understand why you are offering it. If the deal is so good for me, it can't be good for you too.

What they procude:

What they consume
21lbs meat
3lbs potatoes

The gain from Trade
1 lb meat

Rancher: Oh, but is is! If I spend 24 hours a week raising cattle and 16 hours growing potatoes, I'll produce 24 pounds of meat and 2 pounds of potatoes. After I give you 2 pound of meat in exchange for 1 pound of potatoes, I'll have 21 pounds of meat and 3 pounds of potatoes. In the end, I will alos get more of both foods tha I have now.(She points out panle(b) of Figure 3-2.]

Farmer I don;t know.... Thi sounds too good to be true.
Rancher: It's really not as complicated as it seems at first. Here-I have summarized my proposal for you in a simple table. [ The rancher hands the farmer a copy of tabel3-2]
These calulations seems correct, but I am puzzled. How can this deal make us better off?
We can both benefit because trade allows each of us to specialize in doing what we do best. You will spend more time growing potatoes and less tiem raising cattel. I will spend more time raising cattle and less tiem growing potatoes. As a result of specialization and trade, each of us can concume both more meat and more potatoes without working any more hours.

Draw adn example of production possibilities frontier for Robinson Crusoe, a shipwrecked sailor who spends his time gathering coconuts and catching fish. does this frontier limit Crusoe's consumption of coconuts and fish if he lives by himself? Does he face same limits if he can trade with natives on the island.

Although markets are usually a good way to organize economic activity, this rule has some important exceptions. Nonetheless, for various reasons, the invisible hand sometimes does not work. The classiv example of an external benefit is the creation of knowledge.
Another possible cause of market failure is market power. Market power refers to the ability of a single person (or small group of people) to unduly influence market prices.

The pricnciple of comparative advantage
The rancher's explanation of gains from trade, though correct, poses a puzzle if the rancher is better at both raising cattle and grwoing potatoes, how can the farmer ever specialize in doing waht he does best? The farmer doesn;t seem to do anything best. To solve this puzzle, we need to look at the principle of comparative advantage,

One way to answer the question about the cost of producing potatoes is to compare the inputs required bythe two producers. The rancher needs only 8 hours to produce a pound og potatoes, wherereas the farmer needs 10 hours. Based on this information, one might conclude that the rancher has the lower cost of producing potatoes.
Economics use the term absolute advantage when comparing the productivity of one person, firm, or nation to that on another. The producer that requires a smaller quantity of inputs to produce a good is said to have an absolute advantage in producing that food. In our
8 hours of work would yield 8 pounds of meat. Hence, tan rancher's opportunity cost of 1 pound fo potatoes is 8 pounds of meat.Hence, the rancher's opportunity cost of 1 pound of potatoes is 8 pounds of meat.
Now consider the farmer's oppotunity cost. Producing 1 pound of potatoes takes him 10 hours. Because he needs 20 hours to produce 1 pound of meat, 10 hours he would yield 1/2 pound of meat. Hence, the farmer's opportunity cost of 1 pound of potatoes is 1/2 pound of meat. we assumes taht the farmer and the rancher each spend 40 hours a week working. time spent producing potatoes, therefore, takes away from tiemavailable for producing meat. As the rancher and the farmer change their allocations of time between producing the two goods, they move along their production possibility frontiers; in a sense, they arre using one good to produce the other. The opportunity cost measures the tradeoff that each of them faces.
n s sense, they are using one good to produce the other. The opportunity cost measures the tradeoff that each of them faces.


Let's first consider the rancher's opportunity cost. Producing 1 ound of potatoes takes her 8 hour of work. When the rancher spends that 8 hours producing potatoes, she spend 8 hour less producing meat. Because the rancher ne

Now consider the farmer's opportunity cost. Producing 1 pound of potatoes takes him 10 hours. Because he needs 20 hours to produce 1 pound of meat, 10 hours would yield 1/2 pound of meat. Hence, the farmer's opportunity cost of 1 pound  potatoes is 1/2 pound  of meat.

Table 3-3 shows the opportunity cost of meat and potatoes for the two producers. Notice that the opportunity cost of meat is the inverse of the opportunity cost of potatoes. Because 1 pound of potatoes costs the rancher 8 pounds of meat, 1 pound of meat costs the rancher 1/8 pound of potatoes. Similaryly, because 1 pound of potatoes cost the farmer 1/2 pound of meat, 1 pound of meat costs the farmer 2 pounds of potatoes.

Economists use the term comparative advantage when describing the opportunity cost of two producers. The producer who has the smaller opportunity cost of producing a good - taht is, who has to give up less of other goods to produce it - is said to have a comparative advantage in producing that good. In our examample, the farmer has a lower opportunity cost of producing potatoes than the rancher (1/2 pouns versus). The  rancher has a lower opportunity cost of producing meat than the farmer(1/8 pound versus 2 pounds of potatoes). Thus, the farmer has a comparative advantage in growing potatoes, and the rancher has a comparative advantage in producing meat.
Notice that it would be impossible for the dame person to have a comparative advantage in both goods. Because the opportunity cost of one good is the inverse of the opportunity cost of the other, if a person's opportunity cost of one good is relatively high, his opportunity cost of the other good must be relatively low. Comparative advantage reflects the realtive opportunity cost. Unless two people have exactly the same opportunity cost, one person will have comparative advantage in one good, and the other person will have a comparative advantage in the other good.


differences in opportunity cost and comparative advantage create from trade. When each person specializes in producing the good for which he or she has a comparative advantage, total production in the economy rises, and this increase in the size of the economic pie can be used to make everyone better off . In other words, as long as two people have different costs, each can benefit from trade by obtainign a good at a price lower than his or her opportunity cost of that good.

consider the proposed deal from the viewpoint of the farmer. The farmer gets 3 pounds of meaat in exchange for 1 pound of potatoes. In other words, the farmer buys each pound of meat for price of 1/3 pound of potatoes. This price of meat is lower than his opportunity cost for 1 pound of meat, which is 2 pounds of potatoes. thus, the farmer benefits from the deal because he gets to buy meat at a good price.

Now cosider the deal drom the rancher's viewpoint. The rancher buys 1 pound of potatoes for a price of 3 pounds of meat. this price of potatoes is lower than her opportunity cost of 1 pound of potatoes, which is 8 pounds of meat. thus the rancher benefits because she gets to buy potatoes at a good price.
These benefits arise because each person concentrates on the activity for which he or she has the lower opportunity cost: the farmer spends more time grwoing potatoes, and the rancher spends more time producing meat. As a result, the total production of potatoes and the total production of meat both rise, and the farmer.

Economists have long understood the principle of comparative advantage. here is how the great economist Adam Smith put the argument:
It is a maxim of every prudent master of a family, never to attempt to make at home what it will cost him more to make than to buy. The tailor does not attempt to make his own shoes, but buys them of the shoemaker. The shoemaker does not attempt to make his own clothed but empploys a tailr. The farmer attempts make neither the one or the other, but employs those different artificers. all of them find it for their interest to employ their whole industry in a way in which they have some advantage over their neighbors. and to purchase with a part of its produce, or what is the same thing, with the price of part of it, whatever else they have occasion for.

This quotation is from Smith's 1776 book, An inquiry into the nature and Cause of the Wealth of Nations, which was a landmark in the analysis of the trade and economic interdependence.

Principles of Political Economy and Tacation , Richado develope the principle. His defense of free trade was not a mere academic exercise. Ricardo put his economic beliefs to work as a member of the British Parliament, where he opposed the CornLaws, which restricted the import of grain.
The conclusions of Adam Smith and David Ricardo on the gains from trade have hel up well over time. although economists often disagree on quetions of policy. they are united in their support of free trade. Moreover, the central argument for free trade has not changed much in the past two centuries. Even though the field of economics has broadened its scope and refined its theories since the time.economists' opposition to trade restrictions is still based largely on the principle of comparative advantage.


and rancher share the benefits of this increased production. The moral of the story of the farmer and the rancher should now be clear: Trade can benefit everyone in society because it allows people to specialize in activities in which they have a comparative advantage.

Rancher Farmer, my friend, have I got a deal for you! I know how to improve life for both of us. I think you should stop producing meat altogether and devote all your time to growing potatoes. According to my calculations , if you worl 40 hours a week grows potatoes, you'll produce 4 pounds of potatoes, If you give me 1 of those 4 pounds, I'll give you 3 pounds of meat in return. In the end, you'll get to eat 3 punds of potatoes and 3 pounds of meat every week, instead of 2 pounds of potatoes and 1 pound of meat you now ge. If you go along with my plan, you'll have more of both foods.

Farmer: That seems like a good deal for me. But I don't understand why you are offering it. If the deal is so good for me, it can't be good for you too.

Rancher Oh, but it is. If I spend 24 hours a week raising cattle and 16 hours growing potatoes, I'll produce 24 pounds of meat and 2 pounds of potatoes. After I give you 3 pounds of meat in exchange for 1 pouns of potatoes. In the end, I will also get more of both foods than I have now.

As time goes on, you might expect economists to disagree less about public policy because they will have opportunities to observe different policies taht are put into place. As new policies are tried, their results will becomee known, and they can evaluated better.But when the controls were tried in the early 1970s, the results were disastrous. The controls inferered with the invisible hand of the invisible hand of the marketplace and shortages developmed in many markets. As a result, most economists are now convinces that the wage and price controls are a bad idea for controlling inflation.

Figure 1 shows a production possibilities frontier for Robinson Crusoe between gathereing coconuts and catching fish. If Crusoe lives by himself, this frontier limits his concumption of coconuts and fish, but if he can trade with natives on the island he will be able to consume at a point outside his production possibilities frontier.

APPLICATIONS OF COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE
The principle of comparative explains interdependence and the gains from trade. Because interdependence is so prevalent in the moderm world, th eprinciple of comparative advantage has many applications. here are two examples, one fanciful and one of great practical importance.

SHOULD TIGER WOODS MOW  HIS OWN LAWN?
Tiger Woods spend a lot of time walking around on grass. One of the most talented golfers of all time, he can hit a drive and sink a putt in a way taht most casual golfers only dream of doing.. Most likely, he is talented at other activities too. For example, let's image taht Woods can mow his lawn faster than anyone else. But just because he can mow his lawn fast, does this mean he should?
To answer this quetion, we can use the concepts of opportunity cost and comparative advantage. Let's say that Woods can mow his lawn in 2 hours. In that same 2 hours, he could film a television commeraical for Nike and earn $10,000. By contrast, Forrest Gump, the boy next door, can mow Wood's lawn in 4 hours. In taht same 4 hours, he could work at McDonald's and earn $20.
In this example, Wood's opporunity cost of mowing the lawn is $10,000 and Forrest's opportunity cost is $20. Woods has an absolute advantage in mowing lawns because he can do the work in less time. Yet Forrest has a comparative advantage in mowing lawns because he has the lower opportunity cost.

Lamb Tariffs Fllece U.S. Consumers

By douglas A. IRWIN
President Clinton dealt a serious blow to free trade lat Wedneday, when he announced that the U.S. would impose stiff import tariffs on lamb from Australia and New Zealand. His decision undercuts Ameraican leadership and makes a mockery of the administration's claims that is facors free and fair trade.
U.S. sheep producers have long been dependent on government. For more than half a century until Congress enacted farm-policy reforms in 1995, they received subsidies for wool. Having lost taht handout, saddled with high costs and inefficiencies, and facing domestic competition from chicken, beef, and pork, sheep producers sought to stop foreign competition by filling for import relief.
Almost all U.S. lamb imports come from Australia and New Zealand, major agricultural producers with a crushing comparative advantage. New ZEaland has fewer tahn four million people but as many as 60 million sheep(compared with about seven million sheep in the U.S.). New Zealand's farmer have invested substantial resource in new technology and effective marketing. making them among the most efficient producers in the world. New Zealand also eliminated domestic agricultural subsidies in the free-market reforms of the 1950s, and is a free-trading country, ontrack to elimate all import tariffs by 2006.

But these hopes were completely dashed with the shocking final decision, in which the administration capitulated to the demands of the sheep industry and its advocates in Congress.

The administration opted for...On top of existing tariffs. the president impose a 9% tariff on all imports in the first year (declining to 6% and then 3% in the first year and a whopping 40% tariff on imports above last years's levels(dropping to 32% and 24%)...

In contrast , Mr Clinton, though a lame duck, caved in to political pressure.

es can benefit from trade, suppose there are two countries, the United States and japan, and two good, food and cars. Imagine that the two countries produce cars equally well: am American worker and a Japanese worker can each produce 1 car per month. By contrast, because the Untied States has more and bettr land, it is better at producing food: A U.S. worker can produce 2 tons of food per month, whereas a Japanese worker can produce only 1 ton of food per mont.
The rinciple of comparative advantage states that each good should be produced by the country that has the smaller opportunity cost of producing. Because the opportunity cost of a car is 2 tons of food in the United Sates but only 1 tons of food in Japan, Japna has a comparative advantage in producing cars. Japan should produce more cars than it wants for its own use and expoet some of them to the United States. Similarly, because the opportunity cost a ton fo

Yet, contrary to the oponions sometimes voiced by politicians and political commentators, international trade is not like war, in which some countries win and others lose. Trade allows all coutries to achieve greater prospertity.

In reality, of course, the issues involved in trade among nations are more complext than this example suggests, as we will see in Chapter 9. Most important among these issues is that each country has many cizitzens with different interests. International trade can make some incividuals worse off, even as it makes the country as a whole better off. When the United Sttes exports food and imports cars, the impact on an American farmer is not the same as the impact on an American autoworker.

Economics is the study of how society manages its scarce resources. In most societies, resources are allocates not by a single central planner but through the combined actions of millions of households and firms. Economists therfore study how perople make decsions: how much they work, whay thery buy, how much they save, and how they invest their savings.

The principle of comparative advantage shows that trade can make everyone better off. You should now understand more fully the benefits of living in an interdependent economy. Nut having seen why interdependence is desirable, you ight naturally ask how it is possible. How do free societies coordinate the diverse activities of all the people involved in their economies? What ensures that goods and services will get from those
In a world with only two people, such as tne rancher and the farmer, the answer is simple: These two people can directly bargain and allocate resources between themselves. In the real world with billions of people, the answer is less obvious. We take up this issue is the next chapter, where we see that free societies allocate resources through the market forces of supply and demand.

Summary
Each person consumes goods and services produced by many other people both in our country and around the world. Interdependence and trade are desirable because they allow everyone to enjoy a greater quantity and variety of goods and service.

Trade makes everyone better off because it allows people to specialize in those activities in which they have a comparative advantage.

The principle of comparative advantage applies to countries as well as to people. Economists use the principle of comparative advantage to advocate free trade among countries.

Kris has the comparative advantage in making pizza.
Pat has the absolute advantage in making pizza.

b. Kris will trade away pizza in exchange for root beer.
c. one pizza for 1.6 (1.5 - 2) gallon of beer.

correct answer:
Pat takes 4 hour to brew a gallon of root beer and 2 hours to make a pizza.
So Pat's opportunity cost of makeing a pizza is 0.5 gallons of root beer.
Kris ... is 4/6 gallon .
Pat has comparative advantage .
Pat had absolute advatge in making pizza.

The higeset price of pizza in terms of root beer taht will make both roommates better off is 2/3 of gallon of beer. rather than trading for root beer than Kris makes.

Supply and demand are the two words taht economics use most often - and for good reason. Supply and demand are the forces that make market economies work. They determine the quantity of each good produced and the price at which it is sold. If you want to know how any event or policy will affect the economy, you must think first how it will affect supply demand.
This chapter introduces the theory of supply and demand. It considers how buyers and sellers behave and how they interact with one another. It shows how supply and demand determind prices in a market economy and how price, in turn, allocate the economy's scarce resources.

MARKETS AND COMPETITION
The terms supply and demand refer to the behavior of people as they interact with one another in markets. A market is a group of buyers ans sellers of a particular good or service. The buyers as a group determine the demand for the product, and the sellers as a group determine the supply of the product. Before discussing how buyers and sellers behave, let's first consider more fully waht we mean by a "market" and the various types of markets we boserve in the economy.

Competitive markets
markets take many forms. sometimes markets are higly organize, such as the markets for many agricultural commodities. In these markets, buyers and sellers meet at a specific time and place, where ans auctionerr helps set prices and arrange sales.

5.Suppose that there are 10 million workers in Canada, and taht each of these workers can produce either 2 cars or 30 bushels of wheat in a year.
a. What is the opportunity cost of producing a car in Canada? What is the opportunity cost of producing a bushel of wheat in Canada? Explain the relationship between the opportunity
b. Draw Canada's production possibilities frontier. If Canada chooses to consume 10 million cars, how much chooses to consume 10 million cars, how much wheat can it consume without trace? Label this point on the production possibilities frontier.


assumpation:
10 million workers in Canana
2 cars per worker , 30 bushels of wheat per worker


opportunity cost:
1 car 15 bushels of wheat
1 bushels of wheat 1/15 car.

10millions cars need 5 million workers
the other 5 millions workers produce 150 million bushels.
America buy 10 million cars from Canada in exchange for 20 bushels of wheat per car.
10 million workers produce 20 million cars, amongst 10 million saled for 200 million bushels of wheat.
Canada consume 10 million cars and 200 million bushels of wheat
no trade :
10 million cars and 150 million bushels of wheat.

If Canada chooses to consume 10 million cars, it will need 5 million workers devoted to car production. That leaves 5 millions workers to produce wheat, who will produce a total of 150 million bushels(5 million workers times 30 bushels per worker). This is shown as point A on Figure 4.

If Canada chooses. at vertical intercept of the production possibilities frontier.
Canada should accept the deal because if gets the same number of cars and 50 million more bushels of wheat.

6. Consider a professor who is writing a book. The professor can both write the chapters and gather the needed data faster than anyone else at his university. Still, he pays a student to collect data at the library. Is this sensible? Explain.

c. Now suppose that the United States offers to buy 10 million cars from Canada in exchange for 20 bushels of wheat per car. If Canada continues to consume 10 million cars, how much wheat does this deal allow Canada to consume? Label this point on your diagram. Should Canada accept the deal?

7. England and Scotland both produce scones and sweaters. Suppose that an English worker can produce 50 scones per hour or 1 sweater per hour. Supose that a Scottish worker can prodcuce 40 scones per hours or 2 sweaters per hour.
a. Which country has the absolute advantage in the production of each good? Which country has the comparative advantage?
b. If England and Scotland decide to trade, which commodity will Scotland trade to England? Explain.
c. If a Scotish worker could produce only 1 sweater per hour, would Scotland gain form trade? would England still gain from trade? Explain.

10. Suppose taht all goods can be produced with fewer worker hours in Germany than in France.
a. In what sense is the cost of all goods lower in Germany than in France?
b. In what sense is the cost of some goods lower in France?

Buyers of ice cream do not meet together at any one time. The sellers of ice cream are ind different locations and offer
Marktet take many forms. sometime markets are highly organized, such as markets for many agricultural commodities. In these markets, buyers and sellers meet as a specific time and place, where an auctioneer helps set prices and arrange sales.
More often, market are less organized. For example, consider market for ice cream in a particular town. Buyers of ice cream do not meet together at any one time. There is no auctioneer calling oout the price of icecream. Each sellerposts a price for an ice-cream cone, and each buyer decides how much ice cream to buy at each store.
Even tough it is not organized, the group os ice-cream buyers and ice-cream sellers forms a market. Each buyer knows that there are several sellers from which to choose, and each seller is aware that his product is similar to that offered by other sellers. The price of ice creeam and the quantity of ice cream sold are not determinde by any single buyer or seller. Rather, price and quantity are determined by all buyers and sellers as marketplace.
The market for ice cream , like mose markets in teh economy, is higly competitive. Each seller of ice-cream has limited control over the price because other sellers are offering similar products. A seller has little reaosn to charge less than the going price, and if he or she charges more, buyers will make their purchases elsewhere. Similarly, no single buyer of ice cream can infleuence the price of ice cream because each buyer purchases only a small amount.
In this chapter we wxamine how buyers and sellers interact in competitive markets. We see how the forces of supply and demand determined both the quantity of good sole
Competition: perfect and otherwise
We assume in this chapter that markets are perfectly competitive. Perfetctly compettive markets are define by two primary chracteristic: (1) the good being ofofered for sale are all the same. adn (2) the buyer and seller are no numerous that no single buyer or seller can influence the market price. Because buyer and sellers in perfectly competitive markets must accept the price the market determines, they are said to be price takers.
In the wheat market, for example. there are thousand of farmers who sell wheat and millions of concumers who use wheat and wheat products. Because no single buyer or seller cn influence the price of wheat, each takes the price as given.
Not  all goods and services, however, are sold in perfectly. Monopoly. Your local cable television company, for instance, may be a . Residents of your owen town probably have only one cable company from which to buy this service.
Some markets fall between the extreme of perfect competition and monopoly. One such market, called an oligopoly, has a few sellers that do not always compete aggressively. Airline routes are an example. If a route between two cities is services by only .Another type of market is monopolistically competitive. It contains many sellers, each seller has some ability to set the price for its own product.An example is the software company.
Despite the diversity of market types we find in the world, we begin by studying pefect competition. Perfectly competitive markets are the easiest to analyze. Moreover, lesson that we learn by studying supply and demand under perfect competition apply in more complicated markets as well.

We begin our study of markets by examining the behavior of buyers. Here we consider what determines the quantity demanded of any good, which is the amount of the good that buyers are willing and able to purchase. to focus our thinking, let's keep in mind a particular good-ice cream.

onsider your own demand for ice cream. How do you decide how much ice cream to buy each month, and what factors affect your decision? here are some of the answers you might give.
Price If the pprice less ice cream. fell to 0.20 , more. falls as the price rises and rises as the price falls, we say that the quantity demanded is negatively related to the price. This relationship between price and quantity demanded is true for most goods in the economy and, in fact, is so pervasive taht economists cal the law of demand:
Income What would happen to your demand for ice cream if you lost your job one summer? Most likely, it would fall. A lower income mean that you have lee to spend in total, so you would have to spend less on some-and probably most-goods. If the demand for a good falls when income falss, the good is called anormal good.
Not all goods are normal goods, If the demand for a good rises when income falss, the food is called an inferior good. An example of inferior good might be bus rides. As your income falls, you are less likely to buy a car of take a cab, and more likely to ride the bus.

Prices of Related Goods suppose that the price of frozen yogout falls, the law of demand says that you will buy more frozen yogurt. At the same time, you will probably buy less ice cream. Because ice cream and frozen yogout are both cold, sweet, creamy dessets, they satisfy similar desires. Whena fall in the price of one good reduces the demand for another good, the two goods are called substitues.Substitues are often pairs of goods that are used in place of each other,such as hot dogs and hamburgers,sweaters and sweatshirts, and movie tickets and video rentals.
Now suppose that the price of hot fudge falls. According to the law of demand, you will buy more hot fudge. Yet in this case, you will buy more ice cream as well, because icecream and hot fudge are often used together. When a fall in the price at one good raises the demand for another good, the two goods are called complements. Complements are often parirs of . complements. Complements are often pairs of goods that are used together, such as gasoline and automobiles, computers and software, and skis and ski lft tickets.

Tastes The most obvious determinant of your demand is your tastes. If you like ice cream, you buy more of it. Economists normally do not try to explain people's tastes because tastes are based on historical and psychological forces taht are beyond the realm of economics. Economists do, however, examine what happens when tastes change.

Expectations  Your expectations about the future may a
The most obvious determinant of your demand is your tastes. If you like ice cream, you buy more of it. Econo based on historical and psychological forces taht are beyond the realm of economics. Economists do, however, examine what happens when tastes change.
If you expect to earn a higher income next month, you may be more willing to psend some of your current savings buying ice cream. As another example, if you expect the prices of the ice cream to fall tomorrow, youmay be less willing to buy an ice-cream cone at today's price.
We have seen that many variables determine the quantity of icecream a person demands. Imaggine that we would hold all these variables constant except one- the price.
If ice cream is free, Catherine eats 12 cones. AT $0.5 per cone, Catherine doesn't buy any ice cream at all. vertical axis, and the quantity of ice cream demanded is on theand the quantity of ice cream demanded is on the horizontal axis. The downward-sloping line relating price and quantity demanded is called the demand curve.

reminder that all variable other than the ones being constant.
Whenever you see a demand curve, remember that is is drawn holding many things constant. Catherine's demand curve in Gigure shows what happens to the quantity of ice cream Catherine demand when . The curve is drwan assumig that Catherine's income, tastes, expectations, and the prices of related products are not changing.
The demand curve slopes downward because, ceteris paribus,lower prices mean a greater quantity demanded.
in real world many things change at the same time. For this reason, when we use the tools events or policies, it is important to keep in mind what is being held constant and what if not.
Market demand versu individual demand.
So far we have talked about an individual's demand for a product. To analyze how markets works, we need to determine the market demand, which is the sum of all individual demands for a particular good or service.

It also depend on the number of buyers. be higer at every price.

Because we are intereste in , we wil work most often with the market demand curve. how the toal quantity demanded of a good varies as the price varies.

Suppose that American Medical Association suddenly announces a new discovery: People who regularly eat ice cream longer, healthier lives. How does this announcement affect the market for ice cream? The discovery changes people's tastes and raises the demand for ice cream. At any given price, buyer now want to purchase a larger, and the demand curve for ice cream shifts to the right.

As Figure 4-3 shows, any change that increrases the quantity demanded at every price shifts the . Similarly, any change taht reduces the quantity demanded at every price shifts the demand curve to the left.

By contrast, when thers is a change in income, the prices of related goods, tastes, expectations, ot the number of buyers, the quantity demanded at each price changes; this is represented by a shift in the demand curve.

In summarty, the demand curve shows what happens to the quantity demanded of a good when its price varies, holding constant all other determinants f quantity demanded.

Case Study
Two Ways to reduce the quantity of smoking demanded
public policymaker often want to reduce the amount that people smoke. There are two ways that policy can attempt to achieve the goal.
these policies shift the demand vurve for cigarettes to the left, as in panel (a).
Alternatively, policymakers can try to raise the price of cigarettes. If the
If the government taxes the manufacture of cigarettes, for example, cigarette companies pass much of this tax on to consumers in the form of higher prices. A higher prices encourages smokers to reduce the numbers of cigarettes they smaoke. In this case, the reduced amount of smoking does not represent a shift in the demand . Instead, it represents a movement along the same demand curve to a point with a higher price and lower quantity, as in panel.
How much does the amount of smoking respond to changes in the price of cigarettes? Economists have attempted to answer this question by studying what happens when the tax on cigarettes changes. They have found that 10 percent increase in the price cause a 4 percent reduction in thqquantity demanded.Teenagers are found to be especailly sensitive to the price of cigarettes. A 10 percent increase in the price causes a 12 percent drop in tennage smoking.
A related question is how the price of cigarettes affects the demand for illicit drugs, such as marijuana. Opponents of cigarette taxes often argu that tobacco and marijuana are substitues, so that high cigarette prices encourage marijuana use. By contrat, many experts on substance abuse view tobacco as "gateway drug" leading the youn to experiment with other harmful substances. Most studies of the data are consistent with this view: They find taht lower cigarette prices are associated with greater use . They find that lower cigarette prices are associated with greater use of marijuana. In other word, tobacco and marijuana appear to be compelemts rather than substitues.

A policy to dicourage smoking shifs the demand curve to the left.

A tax that raises the price cigarettes results in a movement along the demand curve.

If warnings on cigarette pakages convince smoker to smoe less, the demand. raises the price of cigarettes, the demand curve doesnot shift. Instead, we observe a movement to a different point on the demand curve. In panel(b) when the price rise form 2 to 4, the quantity demanded falss from 20 to 12 cigarettes per day, as reflected by the movement from point A to point C.

Here are some possible answers.

Price The price of ice cream is one determinant of quantity supplied. When the price of ice cream is high, selling ice creamm is profitable, and so the quantity supplied is large. As a seller of ice cream, you work long hours, buy many ice cream machines, and hire many workers. By contrast, when the price of ice cream is low, your business is less profitable, and so you will produce less ice cream. At an even lower price, you may choose to go out of business altogether, and your quantity supplied falls to zeo.

Because the quantity supplied rises as the price rises and falls as the price falls, we say that the quantity supplied is positively related to the price of the good. This relationship between price and quantity supplied is called the law of supply: Othe things equal, when the price of a good rises, the quantity supplied of the good also rises.

law of supply
the claim that , other thing equal, the quantity supplied of a good rises when the price of the good rises.

Input Prices To produce its output of icecream, Student Sweets uses various inputs: cream, sugar, flavoring, ice-cream machines, the buildings in which the ice cream is made, and the labor of workers to mix the ingredients ans operate the machine. When the price of one or more of these inputs rises, producing ice cream is less profitable, andyour firm supplies less ice cream, If input prices rise substantially, you might shut down your firm and supplu=y no ice cream at all. Thus, the supply of a good is negatively related to the price of the inputs used to make the good.

nology The technology for turning the inputs into ice cream is yet another determinant of supply. The invention of the mechanized ice-cream machine, for example, reduced the amount of labor necessary to make ice cream. By reducing firms' costs, the advance in technology raised the supply of ice cream.

Expectations The amount of ice cream you supply today may depend on your expectaions of the futture. For example, if you expect the price of ice cream to rise in the future, you will put some of your current production into storage and supply less to the market today.

The supply shedule and the supply curve

supply schedule
a tabel taht shows the relationship between the price of a good and the quantity supplied.

supply curve
Consider how the quantity supplied varies with the price, holding input prices, technology, and expectations constant. Table 4-4 shows the quantity supplied by Ben, and ice-cream seller, at various prices of ice-cream. At a price below $1.00, Ben does not supply any ice cream at all. As the price rises, he supplies a greateer and greater quantity. Thi stbale is called the supply schedule.

Figure 4-5 graphs the relationship etween the quantity of icecream supplied and the price. the curve relating price and quantity supplied is called the supply curve. The supply curve slopes upward because, ceteris paribus, a giher price mean a greater quantity supplied.


Market supply verus individual supply
Just as market demand is the sum of the demands of all buyers, market supply is the sum of the supplies of all sellers. Table 4-5 shows the supply schedules for two ice-cream produces-Ben and Jerry. At any price, Ben's supply schedule tells us teh quantity of ice cream Jerry supplies.  The market supply is the sum of the two individual supplies.
market supply depends on all thos factors that influence the supply of indicidual sellers, such as the price of inputs used to produce the good< teh available technology, and expectations. In addition, the supply in a market depends on the number of sellers. ( If Ben or Jerry were to retire from the ice-cream business, the supply in the market would fall)  The supply schedules in Table 4-5 show what happens to quantity supplied as the price varies while all the other variables that determine quantity supplied are held constant.

Figure 4-6 shows the supply curves taht correspond to the supply schedules in Table 4-5. As with demand curves, we sum the individual supply curves horizontally to obtain the market curves. That is , to find the total quantity supplied at any price, we add the individual quantities found on the horizontal axis of the individual supply curves. The market suply curve show how the total quantity supplied varies as the price of the goog varies.

Shifts in the supply curve
suppose that the price of sugar falls. How does this change affect the suply of ice cream? Because sugar is an input into producing ice cream, the fall in the price sugar makes selling ice cream more profitable. This raises the supply of ice crea; At any given price, sellers are now willing to prooduce a larger quantity. thus, the supply curve for ice cream shifts to the right.

Whenever ther is a change in any determinat of supply, other than the good's price, the supply curve shifts. As Figure 4-7 shows, any changes taht raises quantity supplied at every price shifts the supply curve to the right. Similarly, any change taht reduce the quantity supplied at every price shifts the supply curve to the left.

Each of the 50 items in this book provides guidance on how to come up with better designs, how to avoid common problems, or how to achieve greater efficiency, but none of the Items is universally applicable. Software design and implementation is a complex task, one invariably colored by the constraints of the hardware, the operating system, and the application, so the best I can do is provide guidelines for creating better programs.

Having analyzed supply and demand separately, we now combine them to see how they determine the quantity of a good sold in a market and its price.

EQUILIBRIUM

figure 4-8 show the market curve and marker demand curve together. Notice that there is one point at which the supply and demand curves intersect; this point is called the market's equilibrium, Th eprice at which these two curves cross is called the euilibrium. The price at which these two curves cross is called the equilibrium price, and the quantity is called the equilibrium quantity.Here the equilibrium is 2.00 per cone, and the equilibrium quantity is 7 ice-cream cones.
The dictionary defines the word equilibrium as a situation in which various forces are in balance-and this also describes a market's equilibrium. At equilibrium price, th equantity of the good that buyers are willing and able to buy exactly balances exactly balance the quantity that sellers are willing and able to sell. The equilibriumprice is sometimes called the market-clearing prices because, at this price, everyone in th emarket has been satified: Buyers have bought all they want to uy, and sellers have sold all they want to sell.
The actions of buyers and sellers narutally move markets toward the eauilibrium of supply and demand. To see why , consider what happens when the market prices is not equals to the equilibrium price.
Suppose first the market price is above the equilibrum price, as in panel (a) of Figure 4-9. At a price of 2.5 per cone, the quantity of the good supplied(10 cones) exceeds the quantity demand(4 cones). Thers is a surplus of the good: Suppliers are unables to sell all they want at the going price. When ther is a surplus in the ice-creak market,  for instance, seller os ice cream find their freezer increasing full ice cream they  would like to sell but cannot. They respond to the surplus by cutting their prices. Price continue to dall until market reaches the equilbrium.


THREE STEPS TO ANALYZEING CHANGES IN EQUILIBRIUM
So far we have seen how supply and demand together determine a market's equilibrium, which in turn determines the price sof the good and amount of the good that buyers and sellers produce. Of cource, the equilibrium price and quantity depend on the position of the supply and demand curves. When some vene shifts one of there curves, the equilibrium in the market changes. The analysis of such a change is called comparative static because it involves comparing two static situations - and old and a new equilibrium.
When analyzing how some event affects a market, we proceed in three steps. First, we decide whther the event shifts the supply curve, the demand curve, or in some cases both curves. Second, we decide whether the curve shifts to the right or the the left. Thirs, we use the supply-and-demand diagram to examine how the shift affects the equilbrium price and quantity. To see how this recipe is used, let's consider various events that might affect the market for ice cream.

EXample: A change in Demand Suppose that one summer the weather is very hot. How does this event affect the market for ice cream? To answer this question, let's follow our threee steps.


EXample: A change in Demand Suppose that one summer the weather is very hot. How does this event affect the market for ice cream? To answer this question, let's follow our threee steps.


1. T


Example: A Change in Both Supply and Demand Now suppose that the hot weather and the earthquake occur at the same time. To analyze this combination of events, we again follow our three steps.

1. We determine that both curves must shift. The hot weather affects the demand curve because it alter the amount of ice cream that households want to buy at any given price. At the same time, the earthquake alters the supply curve because it changes the amount of ice cream that firms want to sell at any given price.
2. The curves shift in the same directions as they did in out previous analysis: The demand curve shifts to the right, and the supplu curve shifs to the left.
3. As Figure 4-12 shows, ther are two possible outcomes that might result, depending on the relative size of the demand and supply shifts. In both cases, the equilibrium price rises. In panle (a), where demand increases substantially while supply falls just a little, the equilibrium quantity also rises. By contrast, in panel (b), where supply falls substantially whil demand rises just a little, the equilibrium quantity falls. Thus, these events certainly raise the price of icecream, but their impact on the amount of ice cream sold is amibiguous.


Summary We have just seen three examples of how to use supply and demand curves to analyze a change in equilibrium.Whenever an events shifts the supply curve, the demand curve , or perhaps both curves, you can use these tools to predict how the event will alter the amount sold in equilirium and the price at which the goos is sold. Table 4-8 shows the predicted outcome for any combination of shifts in the two curves. To make sure you understand how to use the tools of supply and demand, pick a feww entries in this table and make sure you can explain to yourself why the table contains the prediction it does.

If the price of tomatoes rises, the supply curve for pizza shifts to the left because of the increased price of aninput into pizza production. But there is no effect on demand. The shift to the left of supply curve causes the quilibrium prices to rise and the equilibrium quanlity to decline.

Shifts in the supply curve
Suppose that the price of sugar falls. How does this change affect the supply of ice cream? Because sugar is an input into producing ice cream, the fall in the price of sugar makes selling ice cream more profitable. This raises the supply of ice cream: At any given price, seller are now willing to produce a larger quantity. Thus, the supply curve for ice cream shifts to the right.

A household face many decisions. It must decide which memebers of the household do which tasks and what each memeber gets in return: Who cooks dinner? Who does the laundry? Who gets the extra dessert at dinner? Who gets to choose what TV show to watch? In short, the household must allocates its scarce resources among its various memebers, taking into account each member's abilities, efforts, adn desires.

It needs some people to grow food, other people to make clothing, and still other design computer software. Once society has allocated people(as well as land, buildings, and machines) to various jobs, it must also allocate the output of goods and services that they produce.

The management of society's resources is important because resources are scarce. Scarcity means that society has limited resources and therfore cannot produce all the goods and serveices people wish to have. Just as a household cannot give every member everything he or she wants, a society cannot give every individual the highest standard of living to which he or she might aspire.

Economics is the study of how society manages its scarce resource. In most societies, resource are allocated not by a single central planner but through the combined actions of millions of households and firms.

You can think of this chapter as a preview of coming attractions.

an economyis just a group of people interacting with one another as they go about their lives. Because the behavior of economy reflects the behavior of the individuals who make up the economy, we start our study of economics with four principles of individual decisionmaking.

CONCLUSION: HOW PRICES ALLOCATE RESOURCES

This chapter has analyzed supply and demand is a single market. Although our discussion has centered around the market for ice cream, the lessons learned here apply in most other markets so well. Whenever you go to a store to buy something, you are contributing to the demand for that item. Beause supply and demand are such pervasive economic phenomena, the model of supply and demand is a pwoerful tool for analysis. We will be using this model repeatlt. market


What is a competitive market? Briefly describe the types of markets other than perfectly competitive markets.

A competitive market is a market in which there are many buyers and many sellersan identical product so that each has a negligible impact on the market price. Other types of markets include
monopoly, in which ther is only one seller,  obligopoly, in which ehre are a few sellers that do not always compete agressively, and monopolistically, and monopolistically competitive markets, in which where are many sellers, each offering a slightly different product.


What determines the quantity of a good that buyers demand?
The quantity of a good that buyers demand is determined by the price of the good, income, the price of related goods, expectations , and tastes.

What are the demand schedule and the demand curve, and how are they related? Why does the demand curve slope downward?

demand schedule is a table, with rows as quantity and columns as price
deamnd curve is a curve, with price as Y axis and X as X axis.
The demand schedule is a table shows the relationship between the price of a good and the quantity demanded. The demand curve is the downward-sloping line relating price and quantity demanded. The demand schedule and demand curve are related because the demand curve is simply a graph showing the points in the demand schedule.

The demand curve slopes downward because of the law of demand--other things equal, when the price of a good rises, the quantity demanded of the good falls. People buy less of agood when its price rises. both because they cannot afford to buy as much and because they switch to purchasing other goods.


Does a change in consumers' tastes lead to a movement along the demand curve or a shift in the demand curve? Does a change in price lead to a movement along the demand curve or a shift in the demand curve?
A change in consumers' tastes shift the demand curve. A change in price move along the demand curve.

ELASTICITY AND ITS APPLICATION

Imageine yourself as a Kansas wheat farmer. because you earn all your income from selling wheat, you devote much effort to maing your land as productive as it can be. You monitor wenther and soil conditions, check your fields for pets and disease, and study the latest advances in farm technology. You know that the more wheat you grow, the more you will have to sell after the harvest, and the higher will be your income and your standard of living.
On day Kansas State University announces a major discovery. Researchers in its argronomy department have devised a new hybrid of wheat that raises the amount farmers can produce from each acre of land by 20 percent. How shoul you react to this news? Should you use the new hybrid? Does this discovery make you better off or worse off than you were before? In this chapter we will see that these questions cna have surprising answers. The surprise will come from applying the most basic tools of economics-supply and demand-to the markets for wheat.
The previous chapter introduce supply and demand. In any competitive market, such as the market for wheat, the upward-sloping supply curve represents the behavior of sellers, and the downward-sloping demand curve represents the behavior of buyers. The price of the good adjusts to bring the quantity supplied and quantity demanded of the good into balance. To apply this basic analysis to understand the impact of the argronomists' discovery, we must first develop one more tool: the concept of elasticity.Elasticity, a measure of how much buyers and sellers respond to changes in market conditions, allows us to analyze supply and demand with greater precision.

When we discussed the determinants of demand in Chapter 4, we noted that buyers usually demand more of a good when its price is lower, when their incomes are higher, when the prices of substitues for the good are higher, or when the prices of complements of the good are lower. Our discussion of demand was qualitative, not quantitive. That is, we discussed the direction in which the  quantity demanded moves, but not the size of the change. To measure how much demand responds to changes in its determinants, economists use the concept elasticity.

The price elasticity of demand and its determinants

The law of demand states that a fall in the price of a good raises the quantity demanded. The price elasticity of demand measures how much the quantity demanded respond to a change in price. Demand for a good is said to be elastic if the quantity demanded responds to a change in price. Demand for a good is said to be elastic if the quantity demanded respond substantially to changes in the price. Demand is said to be inelastic if the quantity demanded responds only slightly to changes in the price.
What determines whether the demand for a good is elastic or inelastic? Because the demand for any good depends on consumer preferences, the price elasticity of demand depends on the many economic, social, and psychological forces that shape individual desires. Based on experience, however, we can share some general rules about what determines the price elasticity of demand.
Necessities versus Luxuries Necessities tend to have inelastic demands, whereas luxuries have elstic demands. When the price of a visit to the doctor rises, people will not dramatically alter the number of times they go to the doctor, although they might go somewhat less often. By contrast, when the price of sailboats rises, the quantity of sailboats demanded falls substantially. The reason is that most people view doctor visits as a necessity and sailboats as a luxury. Of course, whether a good is a necessity or a luxury depends not on the intrinsic properties of the good but on the preferences of the buyer. For an avid sailor withlittle concern over his health, sailboatsmight be a necessity with inelastic demand and doctor visits a luxury with elastic demand.


As these examples show, individuals and firms can make better decisions by thinking at the margin. A rational decisionmaker takes an action if and only if the marginal benefit of the action exceeds the marginal cost.

People respons to incentives. Their behavior may change when costs or benefits change. When the price of an apple rises, for instance, people decide to eat more pears and fewer apples, because the cost of buying an apple is higher.


The principal of comparative advantage states that each good should be produced by the country that has smaller opportunity cost of producing that good. Because the opportunity cost of a car is 2 tons of food in the United States but. bu only 1 ton of food in Japan, Japan has a comparative advantage in producing cars.

A U.S. worker can produce 2 tons of food per month. Japna has a comparative advantage in producing cars. Japsn should produce more cars that it wants for its own uses and export some of them to the United States. Similarly, because th eopportunity cost of a ton of food is 1 car in Japan but only 1/2 car in the United Sates, the United States has a comparative advantage in producing food. The United States should produce more fodd than it wants to consume and export some of it to Japan. Through specialization and trade, both countries can have more food and more cars.
I reality, of course, the issue involved in trade among nations are more complex than this example suggests, as we will see in Chapter 9. Most important among these issues is that each country has many citizens with different interests. Internaltional trade can maek some individuals worse off, ven as it makes the coutry as a whole better off. Whenthe United States exports food and import cars, the impact on an American farmers is not the same as the impact on an American autoworker. yet, contrary to the opinions sometimes voiced by politicians and political commentators, international trade is not like war, in which some coutries win and others lose. Trade allows all coutries to achieve greater prosperity.

In a world with only two people, such as the rancher and the farmer, the anser is simple: These two people can directly bargain and allocate resourcs between themselves. Inthe real world with billions of people, the anser is less obvious. We take up this issue in the next chapter, where we see that free scocieties allocate resources through the markert forces of supply and demand.

It is a maxim of every prudent master of a family, never to attempt to make at home to make Ricardo developed the principle of comparative advantage as we know it today.

Even though the field of economics has broadened its scope and refined its theories since the time of Smith and Ricardo, economists' opposition to trade restrictions is still based largely on the principle of comparative advantage.

the Moral of the story of the farmer and the rancher should now be clear: Trade can benefit rancer  40 hours 40 lbs  meat 5lbs potatoes
farmer 40 hours 2 meat 4lbs potatoes

rancher 1 meat opportunity cost  0.125 lbs potitoes
farmer 1 meat opportunity cost 2 lbs potatoes
so rancher should produce more meat( 1/8 < 2)
and farmer should produce more potatoes.( 1/2  < 8)


farmer 1 lb meat need 20 hours, 1 lb potatoes need 10hours

Every day

let's look at a simple economy. Imagine that there are gtwoo goods in the world--meat and potatoes. a cattle rancher and a potato farmer-each of whom would like to eat both meat and potatoes.
Although this scene illustrares most simply how everyone can benefit from trade, the gains would be similar if the rancher and the farmer were each capable of producing the other good, but only at great cost. Suppose, for example, that eh potato farmer is able to raise cattle and produce meat, bu that he is not very good at it. bu that her land is not very well suited for it.  In this case, it is easy to see that the farmer and the rancher can each benefit by specializing in what he or she doe best and then trading with the other.
The gains from trade are less obvious, however, when one person is better at producing every good. For example, suppose that the rancher is better at raising cattle and better at growing potatoes than the farmer. In this case, should the rancher or farmer choose to remain self-sufficient? Or is ther still reson for them to trade with each other? To anseer this question, we need to look more closely at the factors that affect such a decision.


of producing a good--that is, who has to give up less of other goods to produce it -- is said to have a comparative advantage in producing that good. I our example, the farmer has a lower opportunity cost of producing potatoes than the rancher. The rancher has a lower opporunity cost of porcuing meat than the farmer. Unless two people have exactily the same opportunity cost, one person will have a comparative advantage in one good, and the other person will have a comparative advantage in the other good.

You know that them more wheat you grow, the more you will have to sell after the harvest, and the higher will be your income and your standrd of living.
One day each acre of land by 20 percent. How should you react to this news? Should you use the new hybrid? Does this dicovery make you better off or worse than you were before? In this chapter we will see that these quetions can have surprising answrs. The surprise will come from applying the most basic tools of economics-- supply and demand-- to the market for wheat.
Th eprevious chapter introduced supply and demand. In any competitive market, such as the market for wheat, the upward-sloping supply curve represents the behavior of buyers. The price of th good adjusts to bring the quantity supplied and quantity demanded of the good into balance. To apply Elasticity, a measure of how much buyer and sellers respond to changes in market conditions, allow us to analyze supply and demand with greater  precision.
When we discussed the determinants of demand in Chapter 4, we noted that , when the prices of . Our discussionof demand was qualitative, not quantitative. the diretion , but not the size of change.

Point A: Price = $4 Quantity = 120
Point B: Pice = $6 Quantity = 80
from A to B:
 quantity changed 120 -80 / 120 = 33%
price changes 6 - 4 / 4 = 50%
 elastic  33/ 50
From B to A:
	quantity changed 120 - 80 / 80 = 50 %
	price changes 6- 4 / 6 = = 33%
 elastic 50 / 33

Mid point Price = $5 Quantity = 100
	From A to B :
		Quantity fall 40 that is 40%
		price rise 2 / 5 = 40 %
	so :
	Price elasticity of demand = 1
	(Q2 - Q1) [(Q1 + Q2)/ 2] / ((P2 - P1) / [(P1 + P2) / 2])


the flatter is the demand curve that passes through a given point, the greater is the price elasticity of demand. The steeper is the demand curve , the sammler the price elasticity of demand.
perfectly inelastic vertical  stays the same . gets flatter and flatter. At perfectly elastic. the price elasticity of demand approaches infinity and the demand curve becomes horizontal, reflecting the fact that very samll changes in the price lead to huge changes in the quantity demanded. Inelastic curves, such as in panel, lokkline the letter I. Elastic curve, as in panel, look like the letter E. This is not a deep insight , but it might help on your next exam.

Total revenue and the price elasticity of demand
When studying changes in supply or demand in a market, The height of the box under .  ：
How the Total Revenue Changes when price changes: Inelastic Demand. With an ielastic demand curve , an increase in the price leads to a decrease in quantity demanded that is proportionately smaller. Therfore, total revenue increases. Here, and increase in the price from $1 to #3 causes the quantity demanded to fall from 100 to 80, and total revenue rises from 100 to 240

We obtain the opposite result if demand is elastic: Anincrease in the price causes a decrease in total revenue. In Figure 5-4, for instance, when the price rises  from 4 to 5, the quantity demanded falls from 50 to 20, , the quantity demanded falls from 50 to 200, and so total revenue falls from 200 to 100, because demand is elastic, the reduction in the quantity demanded is so greate that more than offsets the increase in the price. That is, and increase in price reduces PXQ because the fall in Q is proportionately greater than the rise in P.
Althogh the examples in these two figures are extreme, they illustrate a general rule:

households and economies have much in common.
Who cooks dinner? Who does the laundry? Who gets the extra dessert at dinner? Who gets to drive the car? In short, a house hold must allocate its scarce resources(time, dessert, car mileage) among its various members. taking into account each member's abilities, efforts, adn esires.
Like a household, a society faces many decisions. Once society has allocated

there is no upward or downward pressure on the price. How quickly equilibrium is reached varies from market to market dependingon how quicly prices adjust. law of supply and demand: "The price of any good adjusts to bring the quantity supplied and quantity demanded for that good into balance.


A Change in Market Equibrium Due to a shift in demand .
the weather change the amount of ice cream that people want to buy at . this shortage induces firms to raise the price. the increase in demand raises the equilibrium price from 2 to 2.5 and the equilibrium quantity from 7 to 10 cones.

the total amount that firms are willing and able to sell is reduced. lowers the euqibrium quantity from 7 to 4 cones.

Now suppose that the heat wave and the hurricane occur during the sme summer.

demand curve shifts to the right the supply curve shifts to the left.
In panel(a) , where demand increases substantially while supply falls just a little,
these events cetainly raise the price of ice cream, but their impact on the amount of ice cream sold is ambiguous(that is, it could go either way)

We have just seen three examples of how to use suply and demand curves to anlyze a change in euqilibrium.

The price elasticity of demand measures how much the quantity demanded responds to a change in price. Demand for a good is said to be elastic if the quantity demanded responded substantially to changes in the price. Demand for a good is said to be elastic if the quantity demanded responds substantially to changes in the price. Demand elastic quantity respond  substsantially to changed in the price. substantially.

The price elasticity of demand willing consumers are to buy less of the good as its price rises. Because a demand curve reflects the many economic, social, and psychological forces that shape consumer preferences, there is no simple, universal rule for what determines a demand curve's elasticity,.

5-1e Total Revenue and the Price Elasticity of Demand
When demand is elastic(a price elasticity greater than 1), price and total revenue move in opposite directions: If the price increases, total revenue decreases.
If demand is unit
When demand is inelastic(a rpice elasticity less than 1), price and total revenue move in the same direction: the the price increase , total revenue also increase.

The explanation for thid fact come from the arithmetic of percentage changes when the price

5-1g Other Demand Elasticities

When studying changes in supply or demand in a market, one variable we often want to study is total revenue, the amount paid by buyers and received by sellers of good.  In any market, total revenue is P X Q, the price of the good times the quantity of the good sold. We can show tatal revenue graphically, as in Figure 2.
5-3 The Elasticity of Supply
When we introduced supply in Chapter 4, we noted that producers of a good offer to sell more of it when the price of the good rises. To turn from qualitative to quantitative statements about quantity supplied, we once again use the concept of elaticity.

5-2a The price elasticity of supply and its determinants
Supply of  a good is said to be elastic if the quantity supplied responds substantially to changes in the price. Supply is said to be inelastic if the quantity supplied responds only slightly to changes in the price.


In most markets, a key determinant of the price elasticity of supply is the time period being considered. Supply is usually more elastic change the size of their factoried to make more or less of a good. Thus, in the short run, then quantity supplied is not very responsive to the price. Over longer periods of time, firms can build new factoriesor close old ones. In addition, new firms can enter a market, and old frimd can exit. Thus, in the long run, the quantity supplied can respond substantially to price changes.

## 5-2b Computing the price elasticity of supply
Now that we have a general understanding about the price elasticity of supply, let's be more precise. 
Economists compute the price elasticity of supply as the percentage change in the quantity supplied divided 
by the percentage change in the price. That is

price elasticity of supply = percentage change in quantity supplied / percentage change in price.

For example, suppose that an increase in the price of milk from 2.85 to 3.15 a gallon raises 
the amount that dairy farmers produce form 9,000 to 11,000 gallons per month. 
Using the midpoint method, we calculate the percentage change in price as
	percentage change in price = (3.15 - 2.85) / 3.00 * 100 = 10 percent
Similarly, calculate the percentage change in quantity supplied as:

Percentage change in quantity supplied = (11,000 - 9,000) / 10,000 * 100 = 20 percent
In this case, the price elasticity of supply is
price elasticity of supply = 20 percent / 10 percent = 2
In this example, the elasticity of 2 indicates that the quantity supplied changes proportionately twice as much as the price.

## 5-2x The variety of supply curves
because the price elasticity of supply measures the responsiveness of quantity supplied to change in price, 
it is reflected in the appearance of the supply curve. Figure5 shows fieve cases. 
In the extreme supply curve is verical. Inthis case, the quantity supplied is the sameregardless of the price. As the elasticity rises, the supply curve gets flatted, which shows that the quantity supplied responds more to changes in the price. At the opposite extreme, shown in panle, supply is perfectly elastic. This occurs as the price elasticity of supply approaches infinity and the supply curve becomes horizontal, meaning that very small changes in the price lead to very large changes in the quantity supplied.

In some markets, the elasticity of supply is not constant but varies over the supply curve. Figure 6 shows a typical case for an industry in which firms have factories with a limited capacity for production. For low levels of quantity supplied, the elasticity of suply is high, indicating that firms respond substantially to changes in th eprice.In this region, frims have capacity for production that is nor being used, such as plants and equaipment that are idle for all or part of the day. Small increases in price make it profitable for firms to begin using this idle capacity. As the quantity supplied rises, firms begin to reach capacity. Once capacity is fully used, futher increases inprocution require the constrcution of new plants. To induce frims to incur this extra expense. the price must rise substantially, so supply becomes less elastic.

Figure 6 presents a numerical example of thie phenomenon. Whne the price rises from 3 to 4 ( a 29 percent increase, according to the midpoint method), the quantity supplied rises from 100 to 200 (a 67 percent increase). Because quantity suplied hanged proportionately more than the price, the supply curve has an elasticity greater than 1. By contrast, when the price rises form $12 to $15(1 22 percent increase), the quantity supplied rises from 500 to 525( a 5 percent increase). In this case, quantity supplied moves proportionately less than the price, so the elasticity is less than 1.

Figure 6
How the price elasticity of supply can vary
Because frims often have maximum capacity for production, the elasticity of supply may be very high at low levels of quantity supplied and very low at high level of quantity supplied. Here an increase in price form $3 to #4 increases the quantity supplied from 100 to 200.By contrast, when the price rises from $12 to $15, the quantity suplied rises from $12 to $15, the quantity suppplied


5-3 Three Appications of supply, demand, and elasticity



To see why, consider how trade affects your family. When a member of your family looks a job, he or she competes against members of other families who are looking for jobs. Families also compete against one another when they go shopping, because each family wants to buy best goods at the lowest prices. So, in a sense, each family in the economy is competing with all other families.

Despite this competition, your family would not be better off isolating itself from all other families. If it disd, your family would need to grow its own food, makes its own clothes , and build its own home. Clearly, your family gains much from its ability to trade. Clearly, your family gains much from its own clothes, and build its own home. Clearly, your family gains much from its ability to trade with others. Trade allows each person to specialize in the activities he or she does best, whether it is farming, sewing , or  home building. By trading with others, people can buy a greater variety of good and services at lower cost. Countries to specialize in what they do best and to enjoy a greater variety of goods and services.
